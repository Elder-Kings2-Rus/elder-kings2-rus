 ek_ymis_events.0001.desc:0 "A shouting match disrupts an otherwise peaceful day. My guards are arguing at the gates with someone demanding to be let in. It turns out to be an old, battle-hardened orc, whom I have never seen before. I decide to intervene before things get out of hand.\n\nThe orc greets me respectfully as I approach him. “My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I am here to ask for a favor: I am growing older every day and cannot bear the prospect of a peaceful death. It is my greatest wish to die in battle, but no one is able to best me in combat. Your skill with the blade is well known.

Even though [combatant.GetFirstName] doesn’t want to die at all, [combatant.GetSheHe] is no match for this kind of opponent.
