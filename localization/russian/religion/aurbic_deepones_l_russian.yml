 brethren_desc:0 "The Brethren are a bizarre cult originating in the Cyrodilic town of Hackdirt, who worship a mysterious group of entities called ‘The Deep Ones’ that live in the caverns beneath the town. The most devoted members choose to live semi-permanently underground so that they can better hear the Deep Ones speak to them, and have been known to leave various offerings and sacrifices in hope of appeasing them."
