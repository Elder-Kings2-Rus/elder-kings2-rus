 nocturnal_religion_desc:0 "A loose collection of faiths all revering Nocturnal, the Mistress of Shadows. Ruling over night and darkness, her followers claim she is impossible to understand - which would be by design. To try to understand her is to negate her essence, and as such her cultists try to commune with her in different ways."
