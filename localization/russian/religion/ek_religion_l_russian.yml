It is said that when the Akaviri army heard Reman's voice in battle they realised he was the Dragonborn they had come to find, and knelt before him, swearing their eternal loyalty.

While in exile, suffering in penance, Marukh claimed the spirit of St. Alessia appeared before him and taught him the Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines, which he wrote there on the rocks with his own blood. Alongside their belief in a supreme deity called The One, they also claim that Death is an illusion, and that through living a proper life and expelling all Elven corruption one can persist beyond it."

At its core it preaches of a supreme god called The One, often associated with Akatosh, but later began to incorporate increasing numbers of lesser saints and deities as the Order grew in complexity. Its basis is Marukh’s 77 Inflexible Doctrines, which explains the evils of elvenkind, how to conquer death, and the now-famous declaration that “All are Guilty until proven Innocent”."

Though they still hold great reverence for the forest, years of conflict in the Colovian and Elsweyr borderlands has caused the relaxation or even abandonment of rules concerning ritual cannibalism and non-felling of trees. Though some would brand the Vinedusk as merely heretical bandits, many Bosmer see them in a positive light for holding the line against foreign raids, and thus helping the forest in their own way."

Others Gods include Zeht, Tall Papa's wife Morwha, Tava, HoonDing, Leki, Onsi, Diagna and Tu'whacca, who was thought to be some sort of god of apathy before the creation of the world, when he became a caretaker and protector of souls. The Yokudan creation myth involved Sep, a "crazy" merchant god who convinced the others to create the mortal world to make it easier for more spirits to survive Satakal's inevitable onslaught. Except it didn't make it easier. Rather, the mortal plane acts as a trap and makes apotheosis even harder. In this way, the Redguard view of creation has more in common with the Elven tradition than that of other humans, who view the mortal plane as a blessing."

King Faolan of the Reach, known popularly as 'Red Eagle,' resisted Empress Hestra's Imperial Legions bitterly. With defeat looming, Faolan traded his heart, will, and humanity to the Hagravens in return for terrible power as a Briarheart. While Red Eagle was eventually slain, the Hagraven Cults did not perish with him. Considered barbaric even by their own Reachfolk kin, the Hagraven Cults revere the monstrous witches and their puppets. Many of the Cults eagerly prophesize the return of Red Eagle, who will once again cleanse in the Reach in a tide of blood."
