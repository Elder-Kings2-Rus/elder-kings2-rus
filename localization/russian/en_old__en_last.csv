Maren was one of the weaker of the Lorentish petty kings, but was offered the crown of Dameria in exchange for aid against their foes.;;Xoтя для нeкoтopыx выбop Лoуpeнca oтпpaвитьcя нa Зaпaд был cтpaнным и нeпoдoбaющим eгo пpoиcxoждeнию, нa caмoм дeлe oн был бoлee вepeн Дaмepии, чeм кoгдa-либo.

anb_bookmarks;BULWAR_DESC;Bulwar has always been known as the birthplace of humanity, but also the birthplace of Sun Elven dominion. 400 years ago, the land was liberated from gnollish enslavement by the elf Jaher who was heralded as the prophesized reincarnation of Bulwari sun god Surael. With the people's backing Jaher and his daughter Jexis forged an empire stretched from Cannor to Haless until Jexis' death in 1162. Since then, the land of Bulwar has been a land of schemes and war amongst the Sun Elven heirs of Jaher's empire, and now the disparate lords of the south look for a new unifier of the land. Perhaps a Sun Elf can rule the lands once again, or maybe humanity can rise up and fight for their own destiny? Perhaps the kings of Kheterata can expand their dominion like days of yore, or perhaps Jaddar, a pretender in the east claiming to be Jexis' heir can reclaim his rightful throne?;;Бульвap вceгдa был извecтeн кaк кoлыбeль чeлoвeчecтвa, нo тaкжe и мecтo влaдычecтвa coлнeчныx эльфoв. 400 лeт нaзaд Зeмля былa ocвoбoждeнa oт пopaбoщeния гнoллoв эльфoм Джaxepoм, кoтopый был пpoвoзглaшeн пpopoчecкoй peинкapнaциeй Бoгa Coлнцa Бульвapa Cуpaэля.

Their initiative in preserving the Bulwari magical tradition has been so successful, however, that the szal-Fazil have encountered an unexpected problem: the current facilities are insufficient to handle the ever-increasing influx of students. The current headmaster of the college has come to request a royal edict to expand the college's grounds and continue the exploration of the genie palace beneath the school's foundation.;;

Elyn?yle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fey Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near S?welahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests.;;

Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge.

It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered.

Hopelessly divided against itself, Jaher alone could bring its squabbling bureaucracies together, only for them to kill him. Yanshen today remains as fractious as ever, but fate has laid choice at its feet. In the west, the monarchy in Bianfang rallies to show that a firm hand can unify the land. To the north, the sinister Lefthand Path and the masked Shuuvush seek their day in the sun. Along the coast, the eunuch republics gird their loins for a final fight. And in the center, in the ruins of Jiangdu's hubris, the Blue Bull of Lanjinhui rises alongside the golden kobolds, the peasants looking to determine their own destiny. Which road leads to Yanshen's future? And how much blood will be spent on way?;;

The tiger-like Harimari rose to sentience and conquered all Rahen, ruling it as the Harimraj for a thousand years. Jaher’s eastern conquests subjugated the squabbling Heirs of the Harimraj, who returned to their internecine fighting as soon as he was gone. Now a new Raja rules a deeply corrupt state from Dhenijansar, and is opposed by the Slave Republic of Bhuvauri and free kingdoms in the north and south. Meanwhile, in the far north, an invasion of hobgoblins crashes down upon the Subcontinent, threatening to sweep the entire old order away and forge something new under its three-headed banner.;;Пoчти тaкaя жe дpeвняя, кaк Бульвap, чeлoвeчecкaя цивилизaция пpoцвeтaлa в Paxeнe в тeчeниe мнoгиx вeкoв.

anb_bookmarks;SOUTH_HALESS_DESC;Empires come to South Haless to die. The Harimraj could never tame its jungles or break the fortress-builders of Bomdan, and retreated to rot in its own splendor. Jaher's grand ambitions built the elven port of Arawkelin, but were checked by the Empire of Baihon Xinh. Now, the empire that the elven advance broke against is breaking. Baihon Xinh is shattered by civil war, the Ghost Emperor in Hon Sai locked in a death struggle with his son in Ma Hoang. The crystal queens of Chien Binhrung rally to the dead monarch, while their rivals in Kudet Kai stand with his son. Smelling blood, the raiders of Sirtan and pirates of Pinghoi circle like sharks. The region holds its breath -- while under the trees of the Lupulan, the spirits walk and whisper to those who still listen.;;

Xianjie is caught in the middle, and if disaster is to be averted the Xia must unify. One must stand above all others if the land is to be free from deceit, cruelty, and tyranny. Such a feat would be legendary -- but the possibilities endless, if it can be done...;;

anb_bookmarks;YNN_DESC;The vast Ynn River offers one of the most fertile regions in Aelantir. Here Ruinborn Elves built a new civilization from scratch since the Day of Ashen Skies, worshiping the River and forgetting all about the Precursors. The Ynnic Empire endured from 625 AA to 1205 AA: young conquerors and old dynasts seek to restore it, but they need to come to terms with unruly feudal lords who are still at their prime. Raiding barbarians and brutish Malacnar warriors are ever on the offensive, and the Dragon Cult lay dormant in Rzenta, but their spirit will be soon reignited by the hatching of a Dragon Prince. The Ynn River Valley has been the center of elven civilization for as long as its people remember. Will one of its successor states finally emerge victorious and reunite the region, or will they bicker fruitlessly until the day they're swept aside by unexpected interlopers?;;

It could not have come at a worse time for us, with Escann still not fully recovered from the effects of the Greentide decades later. Many see the Crimson Deluge as a sign of a brutal war still raging in the heavens above, while others see it as proof of Corin's coronation as leader of the Regent Court as Adean gets cast down for failing his duties as the Court's de facto leader in Castellos's stead. No matter the truth, we must do all we can in these dark times to stay true to Adean, and strive to keep our people on the right path.;;

The most egregious theft of land and culture happened in Casna Ola, which was forcefully annexed by Lorent -- and in the wake of an army of soldiers came an army of settlers, who forced thousands of Sorncosti off vineyards that had been in their families for generations.\n\nA Casna Ola native named Re?n had enough. He gathered the refugees of this bitter crisis in Sornaire, and with the help of patriotic fishermen, naval veterans, and dock owners, his ‘Sornic Sons’ managed to pull together a small fleet of five ships and set sail for the freedom of Aelantir, to be the first to build a new land in the old world. The Sornic Sons' plans were mocked and derided  at first, but once news came back that their first successful settlement had survived the winter, support came quickly. Many Sorncosti now flee en masse to the settlement, in hopes of life without cultural oppression.\n\nWith a pinch of luck and determination, they may be able to succeed at making a new Sorncost and, perhaps, even return to reclaim their homes one day.;;Hecкoлькo изгнaнникoв из Copнкocтa, нaзывaющиx ceбя Cынoвьями Copникa, пoceлилиcь в paйoнe Блудгpeйвa в Aэлaнтиpe.

Composed mostly of half-orcs, the company gained fame for their ferocity in fighting against orcish aggression in Escann, but often faced discrimination from employers and other adventurers because of their mixed-race heritage and acceptance of Dookan worship among their membership. Discontent at their unjust treatment finally rose to an open boil in the early 1500s, prompting the company to depart Cannor's discrimination for greater adventure and opportunity in Aelantir.\n\nReports of enormous wealth found on the borders of the Trollsbay led the Chipped Tooth Company to the lands of the Boek at the mouth of the river Ynn. Here the Ruinborn tribes adorned themselves in finely worked iron and gold that they had discovered at the base of the cliffs of ruin. Surmising that whatever advanced people created these goods would be found on the plateaus far above, the company scaled the Cliffs and emerged into the misty hills of Veykoda. From here the Chipped Tooth made their way east and found the thriving Ynnic civilization, where they found ample opportunities for employment among the petty lords of Sarda and Dolindha.\n\nAt first content to live as landless mercenaries in high demand among the Ynnic lords, the arrival of other Cannorian settlers to the Ynn River Valley led the Chipped Tooth's Captain Ot? the Handsome to dream of a land that belonged entirely to the half-orcs. Taking the mercenary band west to the edge of the Epednan Expanse, the Chipped Tooth Company staked a claim over a vast swathe of the sparsely populated western prairie. Declaring themselves an independent adventurer state, the Chipped Tooth became an army with a state, equally intent on living the lives of mercenaries for the Ynnics and as free landholders in their own free piece of Aelantir.\n\n§RThe Chipped Tooth Company will no longer be available for hire.§!;;Пeчaльнo извecтнaя poтa нaeмникoв-пoлуopкoв peшилa cлoжить opужиe и coздaть дoм для cвoeгo нapoдa нa гpaницe Aэлaнтиpa.\n\n§RPacкoлoтый Зуб бoльшe нe дocтупeн для нaймa.§!

The seeds of darkness are coarse, rough, and are found in every single corner of the world. That is why I have made it my, and my order’s, duty to destroy mayhem, and give way to order under Surael. City after city has requested our aid against monster and heretic, and we have never failed to follow through.\n\nBut we have now heard the news of the rediscovery of the homes of our forefathers. The land is said to be abandoned for a few surviving creatures, scarcely elves at all -- in what must be the work of the Malevolent Dark.\n\nThe Exemplars must take on a new purpose: to rescue our kin from the maw of darkness. Surael’s light must be spread throughout Aelantir, and the darkness there will be cleansed, the monsters purged. We set sail in the morning, and by the time you get this letter our fleet will have already left dock. The few that remain are insufficient to carry out the services of the old Exemplars, and for this we apologize.\n\nBut the Jaherian Exemplars must save Aelantir from all that is evil, and bring Jaher's dream to the home of our precursors.\n\nSincerely,\nEcaris.;;Гpуппa coлнeчныx эльфoв, нaзывaющиx ceбя Beликими Джaxepиaнцaми, выcaдилacь в Aэлaнтиpe.

But alas, Cannor no longer had any of those.\n\nSo naturally, they started looking further. Corin preached to seek evil after all, not to wait for it to show itself. And when news came of the Drozma Tur, the dragon cult beyond the frozen seas seeking to subjugate all, they all thought the same. Corin preached to fight evil, no matter how hard it is to reach.\n\nAdventurers from all around Cannor rallied here in Istralore, beating heart of corinism in the Empire. Soldiers of fortune, but also bards from Esmaria, mages from Damesear, rangers from the Alen, clerics from Escann, and even some gnome artificers who claimed to have plans for ships that could break through the ice of the Broken sea.\nBut the first to come was Sybille L?nchs, one of the most famous adventurers of all Cannor, and it was obvious to all members of the crusade that her fiery hair and impassioned speeches were proof that she was Corin's avatar even if the clergy refused to admit it. It was no matter, because they had an evil empire to face, a dragon to slay and an oppressed people to free.";;Фaнaтики и paдикaлы из Иcтpaлopa пoкинули бepeгa Kaннopa и oбъявили o пoxoдe в Aэлaнтиp, бeз coмнeния, плaниpуя pacпpocтpaнить пpaвду o Kopинe cpeди мecтныx Pуинбopнoв.

However, a rather unfortunate string of failed quests and bad contracts drove them to absolute poverty. Recently, the company has gone completely silent, and most throughout Cannor assumed that the company had quietly dissolved, going out with a whimper in the dead of night.\n\nTo the shock of many, reports recently came in that the leader of the Menib?r Free Company, an experienced veteran by the name of Ricard Tenach, had sold all of his possessions gathered from his venerable career in order to buy cheap transportation for his company to Aelantir. Evidently fueled by the rumors of gold found throughout the Epednar Expanse, Tenach has bet coin and men in the hopes that the Free Company can pay their debts.

Last seen they were...' the scout pauses for a second 'they were heading west.'\n'West?!' the captain replies with surprise. There was only that damned forest to the west, along with those brutish ruinborn he thought. \n'Sir, shall we follow them?' the scout asks his superior. The captain reacted with a small grin. 'No need. Those slaves shall be considered lost goods. They won't survive in that forest anyway.' \n\n...\n\nThe forest changed. It was less dense, the animals appeared less hostile and most importantly - Freemen haven't seen a single Cursed One in over a week. Varbuk kept leading his people after all this time, and it seemed at last that the worst was behind them. His scars from whips have healed, his wrists no longer remembered the tightness of shackles. But most importantly, he forgot his master's face. Instead he only recalled the bloody mess that once was his face. It was a good memory. \nBut that was past. The future is what should concern him now. But Varbuk feels no fear. Behind him are his people, his Freemen. Together they fought for freedom... and won.

Some nobles were content to relax in luxury, but in recent years, a new, more energetic generation has risen to the ranks of our nobility amidst a revival of tradition and idealism.\n\nMany of those nobles come from families who used to be minor in united Dameria, but rose in importance in smaller Cestirande. Chief among them is head of the opposition in parliament Varil s?na Cymain? who grew tired to see the duke so frequently ignore the position of the representatives, something he feels never would have happened in former Dameria. He even dared to accuse the ducal house s?l Cestir of moral degeneracy, claiming they betrayed the values of the Empire just as their ancestors betrayed the Silmunas. His outspoken words thrilled this faction of upstarts and when he was threatened with jail, frustration with the parliament’s decadence boiled over.\n\nForced to take a stance, Varil declared the Empire had forgotten his ideal of equality for all and that a clean slate was needed. Most of his supporters have joined him in his project to create a truly ideal country in Aelantir, and the ducal house made sure to support his position, at least officially, to see these upstarts and their dangerous ideas sail far away from Cestirande!

anb_aelantirspawnables;aelantirspawnables.9.d;Old Sun Cultists have always been present in Bahar and the Harpy Hills. Disparate groups have survived in the region ever since the arrival of the elves, and their many small communities thrive in remote mountain valleys, sheltered by the rough terrain.\n\nThe defeat of the akalate of Dartax?gerdim in the late 15th century ended this isolation. Jaherian Exemplars moved into the Harpy Hills and set pyres ablaze throughout the villages, converting the meek and executing the stubborn. This new age of Darkness led to a rise of Old Sun Cult terrorism, culminating with the bombing of the Samartal Summit. The eventual discovery of the perpetrators, an Old Sun Cult sect with ties to the Green Helmets of Kuzak, led to a new wave of persecution -- which was seen by many Old Sun believers as a sign that the Malevolent Dark had triumphed.\n\nThe rediscovery of Aelantir led to many Exemplars being recalled to their headquarters in Elizna, leading to a marked reduction in persecution. The news of empty lands devoid of Sun Elves and Sun Elven interests was seen by Ageela szel-Akal-Uak as a sign from Surakel. His faithful could build a new life there free from Darkness and persecution, a place to shelter and grow the Light. A priestess with hidden magic ability, Ageela gathered the various communities and set off to build a new land for the faithful of Surakel. With the help of Drolakandi smugglers and her own magical talents, she managed to build a fleet without catching the attention of the elves, which set off into the sunset in $YEAR$. These migrants would end up in the Trollsbay, creating the new state of Zanlib.;;Бульвapcкиe кoлoниcты, вoзмoжнo, бeжaвшиe oт пpaвлeния coлнeчныx эльфoв, ocнoвaли нeзaвиcимую кoлoнию Зaнлиб в Tpoллcбee.

anb_events;akan_flavour.1.a;He's a mad prince of a fallen kingdom, begone.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.1.b;Perhaps it is time for the prince to become a king.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.1.c;Refuse him gently, and grant him his estate.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.1.d;When the kingdom of Khasa fell in 1438, the last surviving member of their royal house, an infant by the name of Bashal Keskhasa, was taken away by his retainers from his kingdom's burning capital to a royal estate nestled within the mountains. They swore fealty to our kingdom in return for protection from the gnolls, and the young prince has grown into a strong and ambitious young man. Today he has approached our officials in the capital with a radical proposal. He notes how difficult the decision to crown a foreign monarch king of Deshak was, and offers himself to be our ruler.\n\nThis is quite a bold request, and accepting it would surely lead to war with our overlords, though it may be our only chance at freedom. Likewise, he seems to have his heart set on this gamble, and we aren't quite sure what he plans to do if we reject him. Another option would be to gently turn down his offer but grant him his family's estate to do with as he pleases.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.1.t;The Prince of Khasa;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.10.a;How unexpected.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.10.d;Incredibly the young prince Bashal has attained victory over the gnolls, reestablishing his powerful kingdom and turning his eyes elsewhere. Namely, towards us, who he sees as rivals and cowards for refusing to support him. Wherever he leads his kingdom, we have a new and fearsome rival in Akan.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.10.t;The Unlikely King;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.11.a;This is only the beginning!;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.11.d;We knew that this would not be a simple feat to accomplish, which makes it all the more gratifying that we have. The banner of Khasa once again flies proudly over the capital, who's inhabitants cheered and roared in jubilation at the return of Prince Bashal. Except today he is no longer a prince, today he becomes a king, destined to be the greatest Akan has ever seen. Khasa had fallen far, but that just means we have further to rise.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.11.t;The King of Khasa;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.12.a;Good for him!;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.12.d;We have received word from Khasa, the young prince Bashal has become a king! In a conflict worthy of legend, he has vanquished the beasts that demolished his kingdom and cruely enslaved his people. Across Akan he is seen as a living legend, the champion of Mother Akan and the future king of all the Akani. Time will only tell what kind of lord he will be.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.13.a;Incredible...;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.13.d;We almost couldn't believe the missive when it arrived, however the seal of Khasa is unmistakable. The bold young prince, who arrogantly presented himself in Deshak to seize the throne, has instead succeeded in reclaiming his kingdom. While much of Akan worships him as a savior and a champion of their goddess, it is clear that Khasa will not go gentle into that good night.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.14.a;How could this have happened?!;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.14.d;How. How could a lost prince, banished from his kingdom and raised in the mountains have done this? Across Akan our packmates lie dead or dying, and few that remain are without scars or grievous injury. All of the work of Viakkoc the Mighty, undone in an instant. Much of the pack now looks at us with confusion and hatred, and the future of Viakkoc is all but certain.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.2.a;Worrisome;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.2.d;The young prince of Khasa, spirited away from his falling kingdom just a scant few months after his birth in 1438, has grown into a strong and ambitious young man, raised in his family's estate in the mountains of Akan and vassals of our fiefs in Deshak. He has remained loyal, if vocal about his displeasure of our rule over his adopted kingdom.\n\nToday however, we have received worrying reports that he has petitioned our officials across the sea to crown him king of the Desha, an act that would not only undermine our own rule, but surely drag us into war. Though we are confident our loyal subjects will make the right decision, there is a nagging suspicion that they may very well take him up on his offer and rebel.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.3.a;We'll correct our mistake soon.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.3.d;When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. His army swept through the old capital, seizing it within the night. Though he may have won this victory, it is but a small price to pay to see the last scion of the Khasani flayed before us.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.4.a;Khasa Irtisi!;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.4.d;It has been but a few decades since our kingdom was destroyed, ravaged by those savage beasts from the sands. They thought us defeated, conquered...enslaved. They believed they had broken us. Today is the day we prove them wrong. The last prince of Khasa, the great lord Bashal Keskhasa, has become the new symbol of Khasani freedom, a savior promised to us by Mother Akan herself to lead us out of this dark era. At the head of an army of proud Khasani warriors, he is prepared to reclaim his kingdom and rescue his people, no matter the cost. Today, Khasa rises anew.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.5.a;The boy has teeth.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.5.d;When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. Today he stands at the head of a great host, promising them with vitriol and great energy that he shall restore his fallen kingdom and expel us from Akan. While these may be bold promises, he appears more than willing to back them up with steel and fire.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.6.a;Good riddance.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.6.d;As we knew they would, our officials have refused the prince's radical proposal, forcibly expelling him from the capital. He seems to have taken the news quite harshly, gathering a great host of angry Khasani refugees and brigands. Thankfully it seems his hatred towards the gnolls is greater than his hatred of us, as he has made his intention to invade the gnollish kingdom to restore his kingdom himself. We eagerly await word of his inevitable demise.;;

anb_events;akan_flavour.7.a;Ungrateful traitors!;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.7.d;In a shocking turn of events, the Desha have accepted the Khasani prince's request, crowning him their king and taking up arms against us. The accursed usurper Bashal is already driving his armies into a frenzy with vitriolic speeches, and turning the Desha people as a whole against us. This will be a bloody affair.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.7.t;The Boy who would be King;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.8.a;We can only wait and watch.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.8.d;An entirely unexpected decision was made by our magistrates in Deshak. While they refused his offer of becoming king, they have instead granted him his family estate to use as he wills it. While this may not have been foreseen, or even desired, time will only tell what such a decision will bring for the future.;;

anb_events;akan_flavour.9.a;Khasa rises anew.;;
anb_events;akan_flavour.9.d;The lost prince of Khasa, Bashal Keskhasa, stands victorious over the gnolls of Viakkoc. Across his kingdom lie the signs of fierce combat, proof that he has earned his throne. As he triumphantly takes his seat in his ancestral palace in Khasa, he surveys his realm with glee. It quickly fades as he remembers those that wronged him and his people, the fiendish gnolls and the spineless Desha, worst of all the opportunistic curs in Eborth?l.

Flavour_Amldihr_I01;amldihr.2.d;"An Assembly is called in Amlharaz's Halls. Dwarven Lords from all corners of Serpentspine flow in as ornate doors open; an Assembly like thousands before. Though unlike all before, the halls are not filled with the yammering of dwarven politics, but a silent sense of understanding. One by one, Lords take seats across a vast table fit for a feast. As the last sit, overwhelming thumps of drums fill the ears. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters the Assembly, surrounded by an entourage of Amldavhad Guards. Bearing a crown with the weight of an empire, [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks to the end of the table, pierced by the eyes of hundreds of Lords. Taking a seat upon a towering throne, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes respond in kind with a glare of dominance at all in the Assembly. Goblet in hand, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raises it high. A silence follows for only a second, but it is a second felt throughout Serpentspine, present and past. The second passing, the Assembly erupts in cheers of joy. From Amldihr to the rest of Serpentspine, dwarves cheer away an end of a dark chapter in dwarven history. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lowers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet, though the cheers do not end, nor would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] expect them to.

They wore black robes with only simple patterns, as they were instructed not to dress above their caste by the victors. On the other side stood these victors, the harimari. The harimari were dressed in the most lavish robes one could buy and with the most extravagant patterns a tailor could think of. The negotiations would be split in three rounds over the course of multiple days.The harimari treated the humans not as partners or equals in these negotiations, but as a conquered people who would have no choice but to accept whatever demands were made...\n\nThe first topic of the first round of negotiations was that of reparations for what one harimari negotiator called ""the frustrating nuisance of human rebellion."" All assets of the richest human farmers would go directly to the coffers of the harimari who lost the most wealth during the Blood Lotus and the profits of all luxury crops like spices or cotton would be taken directly by the harimari state. The second one was the Right of Grievance, or more specifically the abolishment of this right. No longer would peasants be able to send their complaints to local lords or to make any requests of their lords. The third topic was military service. From now on the humans would only serve as cannon fodder, footfolk or menial workers and officer positions would become harimari exclusive.\n\nFinally came the question of who belonged in the lower castes. While the harimari delegation put up a united front on this topic, in reality it was split on it: Should the few harimari in the lower castes remain there? During a break in the negotiations, they debated on it and in the end decided to...";;

By walking parallel they entered as co-equals who both wanted to end the conflict that tore the nation apart. The descendents of Harimar and the humans sat down to discuss the reformation of the caste system and through that the nation as a whole. The air could be described as tense yet relieved. The delegations started after the exchange of pleasantries and drinks. The whole negotiation would be split in three rounds with dozens of smaller topics, deals and negotiations.\n\nThe first topic was the annulment of all debts and demands for reparations. It was a contentious topic but one whose necessity was well understood. To prevent any lingering bad blood, all debts would be wiped clean. The second topic was the codification of equality in the military. The army would now operate on the basis of merit, not caste. Humans and low caste people could rise to become a general and harimari upper cast would no longer be restricted to officer corps duties. The third topic was that of economic freedom in the agricultural sector. If they chose, any harimari could now become a farmer and spend their lives in peace on their fields.\n\nAfter some more topics and points of discussion did they come to the finalising of it all; both human and harimari were co-equals in the lower castes and no distinctions would be made between them ever again.

No, they were to be held in a military tent, and one of human command, at that. They had shown the harimari that the era of tiger dominance was over and that the era of humanity had arrived in Rahen. It was a cloudy day and the harimari delegation was escorted under armed guard to the negotiations as the general command held no trust for them. The way the harimari were treated was a sign of the centuries of resentment from a previously subjugated and exploited people. Now the harimari would know how humanity had been treated. Officially, this was a negotiation but in reality the harimari had no room nor power for demands or suggestions. They were defeated and the humans would make all the new terms, split into three rounds of negotiations covering multiple topics. They began..\n\nThe first topic of the first round was focused on the distribution of wealth and land. The human delegation wanted vengeance and so a harsh policy of land redistribution was implemented. The harimari would lose almost all their lands and their riches would go to the victors as a way of reparations. The second topic was the full reformation of the army. No longer would the harimari be allowed to serve in the army, as the humans did not trust any of them to be loyal to the new state, effectively the former rebels were now the legitimate armed forces of the state. \n\nThe last topic was that of the final makeup of the lower castes. The harimari were being forced into becoming farmers, labourers and service folk en masse. While some humans may want to stay in the lower castes, they would be able to enjoy the spoils of the toiling harimari working for them from now on!

I would even dare to say that if I were not a harimari, I would wish to be a human artisan, for the humans are the best crafts folk in the world"" -Radjgut the Elder\n\nWhen the second round of negotiations started, the harimari negotiators began it with poetry explaining to the humans their need to understand their lower place in society and to focus their talents where they had the most potential. They were warned against striving for power not made for them. The harimari wanted to show the difference between the two races, yet did not want to create more anger. This time they showed the difference via food. The harimari were served luxurious, delicious cakes that didn't give the energy one needs for hard labour or crafting. The humans on the other hand received nutritious food that would allow one to work for days, yet tasted bland. Afterwards the harimari laid down the multiple topics of the second round.\n\nThe first topic was that of the merchants' guilds. They were allowed to remain but with additional administrative oversight to prevent them from amassing copious amounts of wealth. The second topic was that of artisanry: The artisans would be forced to give discounts to harimari and could not sell their masterworks to humans anymore, not even to foreigners. The third topic described that the navy would be mostly manned by human sailors, but all officer positions would be taken by the harimari, because only they have the divine right to lead while humanity's place is to follow.\n\nThe final topic was that of the makeup of the middle castes. While the lower castes had only a few harimari individuals, many harimari had been artists and tradesfolk as well. Now it was up to the delegation to decide whether they could stay or elevate all of them into the upper castes, even if it was against these harimari's wishes.";;

No matter their heritage or race, with practice anyone could become a skilled craftsman."" -Roja of SirThe harimari and human delegations were well rested and fed before entering the grand hall again for the next round of negotiations. This round dealt with the fate of the middle castes. The delegations slowly became accustomed to each other and chose to show unity by dining together instead of separately. The multiple topics were laid before them and were mostly concerned about trade rights, monopolies, production standards and in the end the makeup of the middle castes.\n\nThe first topic of the second round was focused on the rights of the merchants and who could be a merchant. It was decided that both races were allowed to become merchants if they wished and that they could both trade whatever they wished as long as they had the right permits and contracts. The second topic was that of the tradesfolk. In older times, restrictions were sometimes placed on who could buy jewellery, certain clothing items and art. These restrictions and any future restrictions are now illegal. The third topic was focused on standards. Both humans and harimari desired the best quality for the best price. A system of standardised quality tests was implemented to ensure the happiness of all. A fourth topic was that of the navy, whose common sailors had always been mostly human but who could never before lead. It was now also decided that humans would now be eligible for officer positions and even the admiralty itself.\n\nThe makeup of the middle castes would now also be decided. Whether it is true or not, many humans and harimari saw artisanry and mercantile matters as a human affair and would prefer a human middle castes. Yet some argued that while they did also believe humans were the best merchants or artisans, this new nation should open the middle castes up to both races. After some discussion and poetic debate it was decided...";;
Flavour_Rahen;blood_lotus_rebellion.301.d3;"""When harimari fight, they must always be reminded who made their armour, their weapons, and their equipment. Perhaps if they were makers themselves, they would show humility"" -Hansim Balgujat, former weaponsmith of the Raj\n\nThe day was unusually cold for Rahen but it matched the mood of the harimari. In their tents, their delegates bickered: How could this have happened? How could their precious system of rule have collapsed like this? How could these simple and feeble humans best them like this? It did not matter. Their complaints meant nothing now. When the guards entered their tents they were shocked again, by their food this time. The harimar were used to rich, complex foods yet were now provided only plain Khapati bread. After their simple meal and plain water they were escorted to the negotiations once more. They sat down and again were greeted by their unsympathetic hosts who outlined today's ‘negotiations'. These talks would be focussing on the middle castes and that would mean that today they would talk about the backbone of the nation's economy; production and trade.\n\nThe first topic of the second round was that of the ‘new economy'. It became clear rather quickly that this new economy would be structured around human ownership of key production chains, trade monopolies and that the harimari would be forced to work menial jobs in these sectors. Functioning as the muscle in manufactories or salesfolk to ease trade in the mercantile sector, yet no harimari could own these businesses. The second topic was control over the navy, which would be fully transferred to humans and who would, just like the harimari, bar any non-human from positions of power and control. The third topic was on restrictions over artistic works and crafts. Human art would have only the regular state restrictions, while harimari art would be banned from the realm to prevent any ""works of dissent"".\n\nFinally the makeup of the entire caste was brought up, and for the first time, the harimari delegation spoke up. First the elder delegate reacted with outrage when he heard that all of harimari economic assets would be redistributed to humans, Secondly the military delegate became furious that the navy would be human only. Desperately the senior harimari delegates begged for the humans to drop the worst demands. But it was already too late, after ages of oppression, there was no mercy or sympathy. It was made clear that the middle castes would be populated with harimari, but that the humans would keep control over all the assets and businesses. After the session, the harimari delegates were escorted to their tents again, yet this time they were treated like prisoners, not esteemed delegates.\n\nThe humans bickered amongst themselves a bit afterwards, as it had not been decided whether all middle castes humans would be elevated to the upper castes or not...\n\n";;

All will be as it was again."" ~Radjgut the Elder\n\nThe day was young and the dew was glistening when the human delegation was escorted to the great hall. This last day of negotiations was nothing more than a formality. The delegations sat down and started by eating a meal. Like before the humans were not given bad food by any standards, yet it was noticeably lesser than that of the harimari. After having eaten the harimari delegation laid before the only topic of the day, that of power.\n\nAll possibilities of humans entering the upper castes were quashed. The harimari would exclusively inhabit the upper castes and all power and rights would be kept to them only. The few humans that may or may not have been part of the upper castes would be expelled into the middle castes and any assets that the harimari deemed unfit for a human would be confiscated.\n\nAfter this short round, both delegations left for their quarters. A final signing of the new accord would be held a few hours later. During the signing the harimari told the human delegation that they would one day rejoice and thank the harimari, but the delegation did not respond. Just before dispersing, one human would speak to his fellow humans loud enough for the harimari to hear: ""One day your claws will be brittle like glass and then we will break them again."" The harimari were shocked and disappointed.\n\nThe humans would go to their hometowns, cities or rebel remnant camps to announce the new laws and caste regulations, defeated and broken by the war and the harimari they returned to their old lives under oppression by the lotus claw...";;
Flavour_Rahen;blood_lotus_rebellion.302.d2;"""One may achieve a lot in their lives, and may seem unnatural in what they accomplish. A society that is in balance and harmony with itself may become supernatural in its achievements"" -Radjgut the Younger\n\nWhen the delegations entered the great hall, they did not enter as opposing sides any longer. Instead of enemies they greeted each other as friends, exchanging pleasantries and laughing a bit before settling into seriousness for the final negotiations. The trickiness of these negotiations were in the fact that if both races were to live side by side in the upper castes, that it was necessary to change the power structure in the nation.\n\n The negotiations were split into a few topics again for ease. Luckily for the delegation, a few proposals already existed in the form of writings by the pro emancipatory harimari philosopher Radjgut the Younger, cousin of the more conservative Radjgut the Elder. Many of Radjgut the Younger's teachings and philosophical proposals were brought to the great hall for the delegations to study and gain inspiration from. Now they may reform the nation for the better.\n\nFirst of all were the courts. While they were normally run by harimari, new judges would be appointed from both races. It was decided that in cases that were applicable to both humans and harimari, the judgments would be by both a human and a harimari who would together decide a verdict. In cases specific to either humans or harimari (take, for example, tail shaving, or insult by one harimari on another in revenge of supposed wrongdoing), the case would be judged by one race only.\n\nSecondly was the question of administrators and magistrates. It was decided there would be no race requirement for any administrative or government position and both humans and harimari could climb the political ladder on their merits. The only limitations would be based upon a person's caste.\n\nThirdly were the military positions. It was decided that the upper castes could retain the right of generalship but that the army would also function in a more meritocratic fashion, in which exceptional soldiers could also rise to the highest ranks of the army and navy.\n\nIn the end, when these decisions were made law it was further decided to elevate the most prestigious and important humans in the realm to the upper castes where they would exist co-equally with the harimari.\n\nNow that the negotiations were finalised and the new accord was signed was it time to celebrate. A grand party was hosted for both human and harimari to celebrate the societal union between the races and the start of a new era; an era of racial equality. Many new friendships were made at the party, many new deals were signed between human and harimari merchants and many exchanged great stories with each other. This future may be new and uncertain, but it would not be faced alone...";;
Flavour_Rahen;blood_lotus_rebellion.302.d3;"""Red will be the rivers when humanity breaks its cage and unleashes its rampage upon Rahen. may this day never be."" -Radjgut the Elder\n\nA heavy rain visited the camp and the harimari had not received any word from the humans about when the last negotiations would take place. They began to fear that there would be no more negotiations and that they would face the end of a blade soon enough until a guard entered their tent. They were to follow him as the human delegation was ready. The harimari were made to walk in the heavy rain, without umbrellas or servants to keep them dry. The symbolism was obvious when the harimari first arrived the clouds began to close in and now, when they were about to lose their privileges and power did the heavens break above them. The harimari delegation entered the tent and were greeted by humans who complained about the smell of wet cats.\n\nThe negotiations were not long as the humans did not deem it important to share most details with the harimari. Instead, the harimari were forced to present and deliver all state files, scrolls, secrets and hidden knowledge to their human conquerors to aid them in their creation in their human-dominated state. The harimari pleaded for a short transition period but the humans were relentless. The harimari would not rule over them again any longer, not even for a single day. Any postheld by the harimari was to be taken over by humans, from the lowest officers to the greatest ruler, all would be human from now on.";;

The attempt at changing the caste system to one that is more favourable to humans has failed, and now the common folk are feeling the repercussions. Many harimari are no longer pretending to be benevolent overlords and guardians of humans, many have instead resorted to terror and open oppression. The harimari are now showing what happens when they are spoken against and a new future has dawned, a grim future for humanity that is.\n\nKnowing that the punishment would be harsh, the humans that were chosen to negotiate the surrender would focus on damage control. They hoped that the worst impulses like mass executions or enslavement could be averted. They were escorted to a military encampment within a ruined palace to formally surrender and discuss terms. There would be few real negotiations and the surrender that was demanded was in all practical terms unconditional and absolute.\n\nThe message was clear, there would be no human victory, not even the slightest hint or glimpse of it. The castes would now not only revert to their traditional makeups, in which the humans inhabited the lower and middle castes, they would also have no way to go up a caste ever again. All castes would be locked and would never open again, at least not under this new, stricter harimari regime.\n\nIt was over, humanity had lost and was now forced to pick up the pieces once more...";;

The benevolent oversight and parental obligation of the old harimari rulers was no more. While they were familiar with unrest, they did not expect the tensions to end in this...\n\nAfter having defeated and broken the state resistance, the humans began reshaping the country. They first came for the administration, which they replaced with their own, seizing all scrolls and documents and forcing out all harimari from their roles. After this they came for the riches of the palaces, the spoils of which were shared amongst the ""most noble"" of humans and then to the common folk. Then they seized the last strongholds and flushed out the last bastions of harimari resistance and arrested all leading figures of the harimari community. The harimari were presented the terms of surrender for all of the realms harimari, and there would be no chance that the humans would allow for any demands to be made.\n\nWhen presented with the new terms, one thing was clear: the caste system would be flipped completely and the harimari would have no say in what changes were made. The harimari were forced into the lower and middle castes to work and labour for new human masters. Their companies and businesses would be seized and run by humans. Now, with the old caste system reversed, the harimari would experience the oppression and hopelessness humans had felt for ages. An uncertain future awaited the nation...";;

Flavour_OneXia_Y99;blue_scarves.2.d;Recently, quite a few public figures in the former lands of Lanjinhui have been stirring unrest against the Xia, some going so far as to incite open insurrection. They claim that, having defeated the eunuchs and the lords along the Yan, the Xia has descended into a despotic decadence that is in practice no different from those same lords. They denounce our taxation of the peasantry and the tariffs we extract along the river, especially excoriating the tithe we extract from pilgrims traveling along the Righteous Highway.\n\nThese dissidents, led by a young and charismatic sage of the School of Flowing Water named Shang Shui, have begun calling themselves the Blue Scarves and invoking the name and cause of Lanjinhui as if they are righteous or justified in their dissent. Today emissaries arrived in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] with a concerning message: these Blue Scarves have assembled a militia and raised their banners in open revolt, and many towns in the former lands of Lanjinhui have joined them in this folly. They cite the war we have recently started as proof of our insatiable and obscene desire for conquest.;;

Whoever comes out the victor is not the crux of the matter, as Surakel's Light will reach the misguided heathens one way or another, but it is clear that a battle would cause much suffering to the populace and priesthood of [Root.GetName].

The szal-Mehran, a reputed Ma?nsih tribe living in the midst of the desert, established a prosperous trade route along the ruthless Salahad. Using strategic locations such as the port city of Ede?ukuru, their homelands in Shimlardu, and the safety of the walls of Azka-sur, these Ma?nsih prospered as guides for the trade caravans who preferred to brave the Salahad.\n\nWith our newfound control over these key cities, the Szal-Mehran are finding more and more willing customers who relish the opportunity to travel through a route under the jurisdiction of a single country, no longer fearing that patrols from differing states may impose a new tariff on their goods. The stability brought by our unification of the Szal-Mehran route has led to an influx of Raheni goods in [Root.Country.GetName] and, though one day the return of safer land routes may render the Szal-Mehran route moot, we can still reap its benefits in the foreseeable future.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.106.d;Today, the leaders of the szal-Zaid tribe have come to visit [Root.Capital.GetName] and asked for an audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They are an important part of the history of the Jadd, as they were the first humans to intermingle with the elven legions that would eventually become the Jaddari. Jaddar spent much time with the szal-Zaid after he joined these estranged legionaries and they taught him the ways of the nomadic tribes of the Salahad desert, like they had taught many legionaries before him, making him a fully-fledged member of the tribe along with all of his descendants. The Mountain of Clear Sight can be found in the territory that they share with the Elayenna harpies, and they were the first humans who recognized Jaddar as Herald of Surael when he descended the Mountain.\n\nThe tribal leaders have brought with them a great many warriors who wish to join our cause and fight for Surael's Light wherever they are needed. These expert mounted warriors were the ones whose tactics Jaddar fused with the discipline of the Phoenix Legions to form the fearsome Jaddari Skirmishers that brought so many victories to the Jaddari.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.107.d;"One of the seven Ma?nsih tribes is the szal-Fazil, famous for their mages and learned men. Local folklore tells that this secretive tribe lives in the ruins of a city hailing all the way back from the Age of God-Kings of Bulwar; Ulmi?bar, also known today as Ekluqebru, the Buried Palace. According to legend, the city was created by God-King Ulmi? and his bound Djinn to escape the tiresome plotting of the warring God-Kings in the west, but his two sons fought for their father's wealth, during this brotherly war, the Salahad desert came to life and buried the city in its sands.\n\nThere is little proof of this, as their dealings with outsiders are done in the desert settlement of Saranza and they keep the location of the rest of the tribe to themselves, most assume they merely roam the sands of the Salahad. Recently, an envoy of the tribe has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] seeking aid in the form of modern tools and everyday goods. Our magi have shown increasing interest in the szal-Fazil and their deep knowledge of ancient magics. They are asking [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to finance an expedition to Saranza bringing the tribe what the ask for, in exchange, a few of our magi may learn of their magical studies, traditions and culture.";;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.108.d;A mysterious desert nomad has arrived in a newly settled hamlet in [szal_ardeth_target.GetName] with an ominous warning: Leave or die. He says he is from the szal-Ardeth tribe, wardens of Amussu's Grave, near which the hamlet settled. According to legend, Amussu's grave hosts an ancient evil that must never be awoken, and the szal-Ardeth are the respected Ma?nsih custodian tribe who ensure that none enter the place and risk awakening whatever may be in there. They say that if the settlement is not abandoned, they will summon the Sihru?am, the governing body of the seven Ma?nsih tribes, and call for a direct attack against [szal_ardeth_target.GetName].\n\nOur learned wise men explain that the Amussu, after whom the tomb is named, is a mythological figure of Ancient Bulwar, one of the fabled God-Kings who bound Djinn to their will and had their every wish granted, he supposedly wished to be the only one who could wish, which rendered him mute. The learned men do emphasize that there must be a good reason to protect this place if the whole of the Sihru?am completely support any and all actions of the szal-Ardeth.\n\nThe skeptical in our court were quick to denounce the words of these wise men as silly fairy tales and ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to stand against the tribals who threaten the people of [Root.Country.GetName].;;

The nomadic tribe's grudge against the gnolls led to them hunting gnoll bands ever since they were displaced, developing a set of brilliant tactics to break their organization and gain victory in the majority of conflicts between them. Their recruits were composed of former slaves who shared their deep hatred for the slavers, and they received support from the Sihru?am, or Sand Banner, the confederation of Ma?nsih tribes.\n\nThough they are followers of the Jadd, which believes in the Enlightenment of monstrous races, their deep-seated hatred for gnollkind makes them care little for if a gnoll is Enlightened or not. The tribe has recently undertaken a deadly incursion against gnollish settlements near the oasis, killing indiscriminately and burning down everything in sight. The gnolls are now trying to recover from the blow, rebuilding their homes and preparing for future raids.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.110.d;Legends say that hidden within the Salahad desert is an ancient city from the time of the God-Kings: Ulmi?bar. Founded by God-King Ulmi? and his bound genies along with his two sons and a thousand servants, the God-King wished to escape the constant intrigue and war of the rest of the God-Kings in Bulwar. He thus fled east, to the inhospitable Salahad desert, where he wished a great city of marble to be built and lived there in peace. After his death, his two sons fought over who would rule the city and take his immense wealth. It is said that during this brothers' war the Salahad desert then came to life and devoured the city whole.\n\nWith the unification of Bulwar, war and intrigue are less and less on people's minds, and adventurous spirits reign. There are more and more rumors circulating concerning the location of the city, which has garnered interest both from rich merchants, nobles and daring adventurers. Our advisors tell [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that we should organize an expedition to uncover the secrets hidden deep within the desert before someone else does.\n\nOne of the Ma?nsih tribes of the Salahad, the szal-Fazil, are said to live among these ruins, guarding the ancient magical knowledge within and sharing it only with a spare few. They are devoted worshippers of Surakel, not recognizing Jaher as His reincarnation or Jaddar as His Herald and Prophet.;;

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nWithin the great hill of sand is a huge depression where the szal-Fazil settled, the Buried Palace or Ekluqebru. Tents, stony homes and various buildings of human craft litter the area and many nomads are watching the expedition with clear suspicion. As the party heads deeper into this makeshift village, they notice quite a few learned men and women studying the magical craft with ancient relics and reactives and reagents that even the accompanying magi know of only due to their extensive research of exotic magical components.\n\nAs the expedition stops by an unearthed well whose supply of water is apparently unending, they are able to gather from the locals that Ulmi?bar has three points of great interest that no one has yet been able to properly dig up and peer into: The Ulmi? palace, from which the God-King reigned; A great library holding untold amounts of knowledge from ancient Bulwar; And the temple of a forgotten God of old Bulwar.";;

Though they are reticent to let the expedition in, they do say that they will not oppose the party with force of arms.\n\nThe expedition quickly realizes that the szal-Fazil host plenty of mages. It seems they have harbored human mages who sought exile from the Empire to pursue arcane knowledge, going against the law of the Phoenix. They have developed their magical capabilities beyond the levels considered safe for the human mind. It seems there is a prominent reason as to why the mages gather here, and also as to how they were able to develop their skills so greatly in the middle of a desert: The artifacts and treasures that Ulmi?bar provides them, they are imbued with knowledge of ancient Bulwar.\n\nOur armed men and archeologists have been retrieving these artifacts as the humans struggled to hide them to no avail. The few who dared defend their possessions paid dearly for their sacrilege. Soon a great pile of reagents, reactives, old relics and ancient tomes is formed in the middle of the town.

At a certain point, each member seems to spin a different tale, but all agree on the fact that the earth shook and an ominous, earpiercing roar was heard far in the distance.\n\nOur brave explorers say that they swiftly fled from the rooms they excavated and found themselves amidst a huge sandstorm, some say that they saw the shadow of a gigantic creature moving among the sands. After gathering as many artifacts as they could, the crew fled from Ulmi?bar along with the panicked szal-Fazil. They heard a final bellow and the earth shook once more and when they looked back, the silhouette of Ulmi?bar was gone, buried once more into the depths of the Salahad.\n\nThe crestfallen szal-Fazil tribe accompanied the expedition until they reached Saranza, their settlement which was once only used as a place to meet foreigners, now their permanent home, and stopped there while our party went on its way with the artifacts they took.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.26.b;We shall have a palace to fit an empire.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.26.d;A quick loop of the mountain on horseback makes clear the nature of the fortress, of all that need be done. The swift bend of the Panuzagnu river cuts beneath the sheer cliff at the mountain's end, the old gate watchful in its long vigil over cloud-kissed peaks of the mountains beyond. The depths of the first citadel remain surprisingly well preserved, still decorated with murals boasting the feats of ancient Bulwari kings, even if they've been stripped of their valuable ornaments. The reason for the fortress's abandonment, however, lies clear in the scattered bones, the potsherds, the broken stones beyond the toppled gates that litter Galuibar -- the Demonscar.\n\nA rift melted through what seems a half a league of solid mountain, by Xhazobine's fury, the blackened gulch has long supplanted the old gate. With the sun shining bright down through the open wound in the stone above, the scene is laid bare. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands amidst the vast rift, gazing down through a scar that had healed into a bustling way lined with dwellings, storefronts, temples, all the long-abandoned cogs that set a city turning. The scars of war seem fresh, even after centuries from arrows still embed in half-rotted posts, to stagnant pools of water beneath shattered aqueducts. The past weighs heavy, amidst the scattered stones of a gatehouse so laden with scars that it seemed to have been rebuilt a hundred times over. If the Ekluzagnu had fallen before, stripped from the Bulwari who first set chisel to stone, from Zehia, shattered by Xhazobine, from the Castanites, the folk of the ?ad Sur... How can [Root.Monarch.GetName] hope to set the walls anew, see that their stones never crumble, as so many before?\n\nYet, the crossroad stands at a crossroads. Shall we exploit this progress to turn it to an impenetrable fortress, or stand upon the shoulders of this splendid progress to make it a palace, a monument to our glory?;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.27.da;While no city is built in a day, a mere decade seems as the blink of an eye, for how far we have come. Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, the black gate stands tall. With its fa?ade hewn from the black stone of the Demonscar, the imposing wall of stone stands in defiance of those who would consign this grand city to history. Even an experimental shot from one of our most powerful canons failed to leave an obvious proofmark in that stone gate. It looms over the sands, deep and dark as the void between the stars. Adorned in marble with fierce visages of snarling gnolls, the vigilant helms of the Bulwari, the Castanites, the Ekluzagnu displays the united will of all who have dwelt within its walls, all who ever shall, that it has stood proud two thousand years, and shall stand two thousand more.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory. Just as it flourished, so too blooms the 'little stone' of the stone palace. While the traders, diplomats, and sightseers are most often drawn to the now-bustling Galuibar's stone-hewn markets, the whole region grows prosperous, into an oasis in the overland route from Bulwar through the Salahad. The ancient dwellings, inhabited on and off for a thousand years now play host to shops that hawk exotic goods from the four corners of Halann, their patios draped in tapestries of elven silk that shield the market from the beating sun of the great rift above. The cries of exotic beasts, the smell of a thousand cuisines welcome weary travelers.;;

Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, Ekluzagnu has bloomed into an oasis in every sense. An ancient spiral pipework that delves down to some hidden enclave at the river still faithfully pipes water through the citadel even after what must have been a thousand and odd years. It feeds a system of pipelike flows tucked away in the eaves of the caverns, which themselves feed crystal-clear pools of water scattered through the labyrinthine twists of the hand-hewn city. The few shafts of sunlight that peek in past the shattered crest of the mountain foster bountiful gardens, planters and hanging pots filled with topsoil from the fertile land downstream.

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.31.d;For centuries, the Zan?api of the Sad Sur mountains have celebrated the Umaslu, the Day of the Sheep, on the winter solstice.

Towns across the land have started to host their own versions of the festival, borrowing the Zan?api name and rituals (even if no mountains cast any animal-shaped shadows in their vicinity). The herders, hearing about this, have mostly reacted with amusement, along with delight at this new-found market for their livestock. Now that word has reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must decide [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reaction as well: should [Root.GetName] embrace this new tradition, with a state-sponsored feast at the next solstice, or should we leave it the domain of the peasants?;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.38.d;The rivers of Bulwar are the second-greatest blessing Surael gave His people, only after the blazing sun in the sky above. The great Suran and mighty Buranun transform an arid land into a fertile cradle, driving desert (along with starvation) back much as Surael beats back the Darkness.\n\nThis truth has given recent events a chilling undertone: The Suran has swollen to a volume not seen in centuries, over-flowing its banks and flooding the surrounding lands. Crops have rotted under feet of water, irrigation channels have been washed away, even some citizens of [Root.GetName] have drowned in the face of a flash-flood.\n\nWe will recover as best we can, and break out the emergency grain supplies to stave off famine, but many will never look at the Suran the same way, knowing this great life-giver can deal death and devastation as well.;;

Lentils, peas, barley, even more temperamental spices and coffee plants, all breaking records for the harvest. Such is life along the Suran this year, and life is good.\n\nIt seems the floods of yesteryear brought with them a wash of new sediments from the Serpentspine, revitalizing the surrounding farmland. The region has been inundated with verdure as much as it was inundated with floodwaters prior. Whether it was just a lucky coincidence, the result of some magical mineral contained in the sediment, or (as is proclaimed by every priest in every temple) a blessing from Surael, this year is the best harvest in generations.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.42.a;We could try to hire him.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.42.d;"Yesterday a brawl happened in a tavern from [Root.Capital.GetName]. As the guards stopped the fighting and threw the various agitators in jail for the night, they were not surprised to find the renowned bard Burat Kaza? among the jailed. Infamous throughout Bulwar for both his singing and his range of insults, he had apparently recited his famous poem 'Utur-Irnitu' (Great Success) in front of some Gelkari merchants, who were enraged at the words he used against their homeland.\n\n'And now let me sing of my neighbour, Gelkali. He is a pain in my buttholes. I live in mountains, he lives in mountains. I have shepherds, he has shepherds. I don't get kidnapped by harpies, he does. My country names means ""kingdom of the moon"", his doesn't mean shit. Great Success !'\n\nBurat indeed comes from a mountain clan from Kuzaram where he lived as a shepherd before going throughout Bulwar to live from his bardic skills. He seems to only have one goal : praise the valorous Kuzarami and demean his rival Gelkali.\n\nWhile not a very popular figure in Gelkali lands, his art is very sought by the masses and all rulers of Bulwar have wanted to enlist him at their service. Despite the fact that our guards threw him in prison, he seems to have taken an interest in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], offering to serve us with all his skills and make the beauty of our court known for eternity.";;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.43.d;A Magi has recently revealed that they have led an expedition that revealed the existence of ancient Magi tablets. These tablets likely pertain to the times when genie-binding God-Kings ruled all of Bulwar. Already, Magi conclaves across the country have disputed the dating of these tablets and grand debates are being officiated to know whether one of the secretive God-Kings actually wrote its contents or if they are better dated in the times of the following Karqa?lu Empire, whose Magi were of much lesser power. \n\nWhether one side or another is right, it does not matter to the Magi who found the tablets, who keeps them in their own private collection. After careful study of its contents, their newfound knowledge has been found to be of use by the court and they have offered their services to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cabinet.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.44.a;And so the Council begins!;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.44.d;Priests and scholars from all over Bulwar are starting to arrive at [Root.Capital.GetName]. A palace was donated by the city’s wealthiest landlord, to be used as residence for the members of the Council, and to house the debates in his great hall.\n\nThe city watch joined the Eduz-nabari to protect the palace, as thousands of citizens crowd the streets, so that they may witness this historical moment.\n\nHundreds of scribes and assistants come and go from the palace at all hours, carrying boxes of paper and ink, holy books, and cult objects.\n\nSoon, the Council will begin, and the future of our faith will be decided.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.44.t;The Council of [Root.Capital.GetName];;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.45.a;The sects kept the faith alive.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.45.b;It is our state that allowed the light to shine again.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.45.d;The Council's first topic was the decentralized nature of our faith. While united by our belief that Jaher wasn’t Surakel Reborn, and that the Sun Elves hold no intrinsic divinity, outside of our core tenets there are few points of union between the different sects, and even less between the old faithful and those who converted from the New Sun Cult or from the Jadd.\n\nWhile those differences are being slowly removed by achieving consensus, one point arose that is resulting very problematic: the role of the state and the sects in the preservation of our beliefs.\n\nSome believe that the followers and the priests were the ones keeping the Light, risking their lives if they were ever discovered by the Sun Elf inquisitors. \n\nOthers say that our state, successful in war against the heretics, was the one that kept the Light and allowed it to shine again.\n\nWhile both positions hold some truth, our advisors believe that [Ruler.GetName] should publicly support one of them to end this discussion and allow the Council to continue.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.45.t;First Debate - Keepers of the Light;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.46.a;The people can be inspire by the divine.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.46.c;The temples and the masses have failed the light before.;;
Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.46.d;After months of debate, a second problem has arisen, once again occupying the minds of the priests and halting the Council's progress.\n\nSome of the priests claim that ordinary people can be inspired by the divine, and that priests should not have a monopoly on faith, since the fight against darkness is internal and individual.\n\nOthers claim that it is the role of the priest, since time immemorial, to guide the faithful and lead the communities.\n\nFinally, some of our closest followers say that both the people and the priests have failed in the light before, and that it is the role of the ruler to guide the faithful.\n\nAgain, our advisors believe that [Ruler.GetName] should publicly support one of them to end this discussion and allow the Council to continue.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.47.d;As the Council comes to a closure, the political topics start replacing the religious ones, and again, a new debate is threatening to stop the Council.\n\nThe matter this time is the organization of the Cult, more specifically, what type of hierarchy will be established, as the different sects and temples were virtually independent from one another for centuries.\n\nSome advocate for a more decentralized hierarchy, with a Synod acting as the supreme authority of the Cult, \n\nothers for a High Ka?ra, a head priest elected by the state to act as the Isiak Surake?, the head of the clergy.\n\nThere are intermediate options too, as some want a High Ka?ra, but elected by the temples, while the clergy from the Suran plain support the idea of a High Council formed by the Ka?ra of the main temples of Bulwar.\n\nAs before, [Ruler.GetName] should publicly support one of them to end this discussion and allow the Council to end.;;

Flavour_Bulwar;bulwar_flavour.48.d;Since the Age of Petty Kingdoms  the Cult has been divided. First it split into sects, and later the Sun Elf arrived and established their own version of our Cult, claiming that they were restoring the old traditions, while at the same time spreading their lies about Jaher’s divinity.\n\nBut now we achieved true unity, and from Azka-szel-Azka to Azka-szel-Udam, from Brasan to Azka-Sur, every Sun cultist shares the same beliefs, the same practices, the same hymns. We worship Surakel in the streets and no longer in secret.\n\nSurakel is the god we worship, as he is the Sun that shines over Bulwar.;;

anb_events_religion;corinite.100.d;There are rituals and forms associated with a Pantheonic council, laid down in the centuries since worship of the Regent Court was first codified. There must be a gathering of every deity's high priest. There must be at least seven days of discussion, a further seven days of debate. There are required rites of thanksgiving, of divination, of worship.\n\nThe Tenth Pantheonic Council does not follow these rules. It is a conclave of adventurer-clerics, a smattering from each deity, led by Dominic of Gallowspeak (lately of Nerat, now sworn to Corin). It is less a discussion than a proclamation: Corin was not slain in truth, but instead redeemed Agrados' failures and ascended to take that fallen god's place in the Court. Or perhaps it less a proclamation than a wildfire, spreading quick amongst the Escanni adventurers, following them back to their homes across Cannor, and there spreading like a spark in dry kindling.\n\nFinally, it seems the temples themselves have issued statements acceding to this truth, even as they quibble about Agrados' heresy and her status as avatar.

anb_events_religion;corinite.101.d;There are rituals and forms associated with a Pantheonic council, laid down in the centuries since worship of the Regent Court was first codified. There must be a gathering of every deity's high priest. There must be at least seven days of discussion, a further seven days of debate. There are required rites of thanksgiving, of divination, of worship.\n\nNone of those rules were followed in the so-called Tenth Pantheonic Council. It was a conclave of unruly adventurer-clerics, many barely literate in the teachings of their deity, led by the previously-unknown Dominic of Gallowspeak. It is less a discussion than wild speculation: Corin was not slain in truth, but instead moved beyond cursed Agrados' heresy and ascended to take that fallen god's place in the Court. Or perhaps it less a proclamation than a wildfire — these beliefs grew fast amongst Escanni adventurers, followed them back to their homes across Cannor, and there spread like a spark in dry kindling.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has well-noted the growing faith in Her ascension, and it seems today the temples themselves have issued statements agreeing to this status. They note further discussion is necessary about Her relationship to Agrados and all his failings, but they shall not stand before the tide. Let it be proclaimed across [Root.GetName], so all may learn that Corin has joined the Regent Court, as goddess of war, bravery, and heroism.;;

anb_events_religion;corinite.2.d;As the prophets of Corin spread her message across the continent, what can only be described as an apocalyptic scene has transpired in many parts of the Empire: the sky would darken, as if about to rain, only to open and release a torrent of blood onto the unsuspecting citizens. Horrified, crowds of people rushed through the streets, trying to escape from the plasma showers. Many were crushed and trampled as they attempted to escape what could only seem to be the end of the world. Whether someone acknowledges Corin or Adean as their divine mother or father, all agree that this is irrefutable evidence of a bloody and terrible war in the heavens themselves. It is only a matter of time that rivers are not fed by the blood of gods, but by the blood of men.;;Пo мepe тoгo, кaк пpopoки Kopин pacпpocтpaняют cвoe пocлaниe пo вceму кoнтинeнту, вo мнoгиx чacтяx Импepии пpoиcxoдилo тo, чтo мoжнo oпиcaть тoлькo кaк aпoкaлиптичecкaя cцeнa: нeбo пoтeмнeлo, кaк будтo вoт-вoт пoйдeт дoждь, тoлькo для тoгo, чтoбы oткpыть и пpoлить пoтoк кpoви нa ничeгo нe пoдoзpeвaющиx гpaждaн.

But with the coming of Jaher to Brasan, the priests down in Bulwar declared him to be his divine incarnation. He did well, he freed us from the gnolls and forged Bulwar into a great empire. But he died, and his successors the 'Sun' Elves have been but pale impressions of his radiance. Now there is disagreement; many say the Sun Elves now all share the spirit of Surakel. But in the far east, a group of Sun Elves has started saying that it's not only Sun Elves that have to fulfill Surakel's duties, but that it falls to all. However, there are still those closer to home who say that Jaher was never the incarnation of Surakel and that we must still wait for the reincarnation of our Sun God.

anb_institutions;desc_city_of_ideas_brasan;Brasan is the greatest trading city in Bulwar and perhaps all of the Divenhal Sea. Merchants from southern Cannor and northern Sarhal congregate here and mingle with the merchants of Bulwar, creating an atmosphere of exchange both mercantile and intellectual. Of particular note is the city's connection to the Cannorian city of Port Jaher. The two cities are somewhat sisters, with many merchants having residences in both. This means that new ideas that spread to one city quickly spread to the other.;;
anb_institutions;desc_city_of_ideas_davharral;The small port city of Davharral has an importance that outstrips its apparent grandeur. Davharral is the first stop for merchant caravans crossing the far Salahad from Bulwar to Rahen, bringing with them exotic goods and ideas. The city's merchants run a profitable business based around this, ensuring that traveling merchants can arrive safely whether it takes a fleet or an army. The nature of this trading link is such that new ideas and information are carried as much as new goods, making Davharral the home of many agents of Raheni lords looking for news and events from the west. Unlike many similar cities, Davharral sees its greatest business as the market season wanes, playing host to merchants returning from the Bulwari city of Sareyand newly enriched with treasure and information.;;
anb_institutions;desc_city_of_ideas_port_jaher;Port Jaher was established several hundred years ago by the legendary Sun Elf conqueror Jaher. The city has always had a connection with Bulwar, and many Bulwari merchants make temporary or permanent residence there. The same can be said of the native Busilari, many of whom own villas in the Bulwari port city of Brasan, where they stay while conducting business there. The large Bulwari community in Port Jaher and the links between the two cities means that they are closer than geography would appear, with new ideas and social movements spreading freely between the two.;;
anb_institutions;desc_city_of_ideas_sareyand;Sareyand is the first stop in Bulwar for Raheni merchants, acting as a clearinghouse for goods that are carried further into Bulwar by native Bulwari traders. During the height of the market season, the city becomes an ocean of people, with great tent cities built outside to handle the incoming merchants and their goods. Such a great mass of weary and wealthy travelers attracts mongers and performers in the same manner as a smaller market, turning the meeting of merchants into something like a festival. Within this atmosphere, ideas flow as freely as coin and drink, giving Bulwar any new insights from the Raheni caravanserai city of Davharral and giving the merchants of Rahen new ideas to carry back to that city on the return trip.;;

On foggy days, it is not possible to see the top, nor to see below from the top; for this picturesque quality, it is also nicknamed ""The Mistpiercer"".";;
anb_modifiers;desc_m_arca_venaan;Arca Venaan, more than a structure, is a love song to the elven race. A spiral tower of the most lucent teal, it has been decorated with floral patterns, waves and clouds on the outside. Its interior is wide enough to allow an open atrium, at the center of which rises a marble pillar with the statues of important elves carved onto its sides. To connect guests and travellers to the Ynnic plateau, a wide, winding staircase hugs the tower's walls, twisting and turning as it rises around the pillar, all the way to the upper floor parallel to the Cliffs of Ruin. On the walls, a diagonal mural accompanies the staircase, depicting episodes of elven history from the War of Broken Chains, to the Ruin of Aelantir, to the landing of Munas to Endrallian's rediscovery of Aelantir in 1500 AA.\n\nWhile scholars are still at work uncovering secrets of elven history and, as they do, they are bound to find inaccuracies with some of the mural's portrayals, none can deny its artistic power: guests often travel the entire length of the tower without realizing, engrossed as they are in following the mural.;;

Travellers can be delighted at the flowers and flora that have been carefully planted all along the Walkway's length, from Lorentish roses to Marlliander Crimson Lilies, to Aelantiri species such as Grebniesther White Berries and Selphereg Saffrons. Proposals to import Man-Eating Sunflowers from Rezankand have however been rejected after some unfortunate complications.;;

Her favored tactic was to draw her enemies into the mountains, harrying and confusing her prey before shattering them with one decisive ambush. It was in this method that she slew the akal of Zan?ap, who had the gall to claim the ?ad Sur as his own homeland and yet in the end found himself victim to its labyrinthine passes.\n\n Galvanized by this victory, she would soon force the remaining mountain packs to submit to her ambitions and would go on to earn the epithet 'Cleaver-of-Realms' by subjugating the city of Bulwar after besting Karodir I Varamzuir in magical combat.;;

Comprising 10 volumes, its themes range from basic knowledge about magic and quasi-religious incantations, to ancient conjuration and divination spells and techniques - some of which were thought to be lost - including some related to genie binding. The tenth volume is considered one of the most important by its author. It was written as a code of behaviors and good practices that all Bulwari magi should follow to avoid the despicable practices of the magi that led the Bulwari to support the elven ban on the use of magic.;;

Some say that the artifacts could be useful to make new scientific breakthroughs, while others argue that they cannot be used in such a way  because the Djinns used magic instead of technology. While the whole discussion was pointless, it left several scholars enraged and almost caused a war between Cannor and Bulwar, but the scholars came with some new ideas to implement.";;

Both the left and right side of the frieze illustrate the fight between the god-kings of Ancient Bulwar.

The bowl confused our scholars, because these items were normally made of clay and used by practitioners of conjuration, and this bowl is inscribed with a divination spell, written in an ancient language related to northern Raheni, not to mention their expensive materials of dwarven origin. One of the scholars thinks that the bowl was used in a submersion ritual in which the bowl was placed face down in a vessel full of water, and this, according to the scholar, would 'bind' the future to the recipient, showing it to the magi.;;

However, in a time as dire and chaotic as this, it may be prudent, or even neccesary to facilitate the spread of this information to the broader public; if regular civilians are more prepared and knowledgable about how to defeat vampires, our problems may be over much faster than originally anticipated.

They hold land, titles, and positions all throughout our realm, and have influence over all stages of governance. While the government was content to allow this in the past, the current situation proves that it would be better for us all if they were killed.\n\nWhen a local noble was revealed as a vampire, an angry mob of peasants formed and marched on the vampire's manor, where they managed to force him to flee his estate. After looting the place, the mob continued on, and stormed the homes of two other minor nobles in the area, looting those as well. In the aftermath, it was found that neither of the nobles they killed were vampires, and that they were unjustly murdered. While they did kill a vampire, this sort of incident is difficult to justify, and the nobility threatens consequences for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if they fail to put the peasants in their place.;;

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.1.d;Escann has known many forms of war over the millennia, which have left its land well-watered with blood. There was Castan II Beastbane's crusade against the Deepwoods, which turned vast forests into ash and slew countless centaurs, satyrs, and other Fey creatures. There was the War of the Sorcerer-King, when new elven might clashed against the powerful magics of Nichmer and his acolytes. And of course there was the Greentide, which crushed historic nations into rubble, proud peoples into refugees, and great cities into ruins. But it has never known war like this.\n\nThis will be no crusade, no fight of 'good' against 'evil'. This is war of brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. There is no war more violent, no war more vicious.\n\nSoon, a land which only recently began to again hear the sound of Tellum town criers will find it replaced by the gruesome, destructive cacophony of cannonfire. The engineers responsible for rebuilding Castonath and cities across the land shall turn to the design of new fortifications and artillery.\n\nNot all Escanni dread the horrors of war, however. In tall towers and great palaces, Witch-Kings imagine themselves rivals to Nichmer himself, soon to ascend over all Escann, nay, all Cannor (but of course, any such conquest must begin with §RCastonath§!). Vertesker and Nathalairey merchants are already delivering the latest weaponry from Telgeir and the Dragon Coast as they come to pick up Orcish slaves. And, of course, the number of adventurer captains offering themselves to the highest bidder has risen dramatically, with no shortage of veteran soldiers willing to join these mercenary armies.;;Boйнa пpишлa к Эcкaнну.

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.11.d;"Anbennar means unity. Unity means Anbennar. Such was the dream of the Grand Summit of Aranth?l, when mages forged a peace out of the squabbling warlords of the post-Jexisian Interregnum. That the people of the Dameshead might unite, might choose peace over war, prosperity over bloodshed.\n\nBut even from the beginning, that peace was laced with lies. Held together only by mages' might, it quickly devolved into the Wars of Rule. And then the Lilac Wars, first, second, third and fourth. Now, it seems, one more such war has ended. A new Emperor takes the Dove Throne, a new dynasty to add to all those who have contested it over the centuries.\n\nIn Anbennc?st, [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is presented with crown and scepter, the same once held by Riann?n Silmuna, the same once held by Lothane s?l Wex III. The Electors look on; they all know their fate if they would object. The Emperor's first order of business is to declare the Emperorship hereditary, never to leave the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line. [Root.UsurpEmperorDynasty]\n\nAnd so a new chapter in the history of Anbennar, the history of all Halann, dawns.";;

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.20.descBypass;Castanor — the greatest of all human empires in Cannor — prided itself on bringing civilization to the formally wild lands of Cannor. Under Castan II 'Beastbane', the fey-tainted Deepwoods were cut in half, allowing human settlements to grow and prosper. Under Castan VI 'Giantsbane', the last of the murderous giants were driven off from the northern frontier. Later Castans would add more lands under their enlightened rule, the consequences of which are still felt in that much of Cannor still speaks some variation of Common. How could any nation possibly live up to its legacy?\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] spending more and more time strolling between the marble busts and stone statues of Castonath's Pantheonway. The relative silence of the district, employed by many as a refuge from the constant shouts of merchants and low murmur of conversation of the rest of the city, was instead deafening to [Root.Monarch.GetName], letting untoward thoughts and doubts rush in unimpeded. Doubts, of the nature of rulership, of the direction of [Root.GetName], amongst others. And so, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sought wisdom and insight while walking between forever-frozen scenes of Castans past.\n\nHow did these near mythical figures forge Castanor into a continent spanning empire? How did they ensure the prosperity of their people? How did they bring civilization to all of Cannor uninterrupted for so many centuries, through myriad times of war and conflict, from the demonic gnollish Xhazobine, through the last death throes of the mighty Giantkin as they broke against Castanor's walls, and through the destructive advent of Zaamalot the Black during the Dragonwake, blackening Castonath itself with dragonfire?;;
anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.20.descWar;For [Root.Monarch.GetName], the days following the end of the Escanni Wars of Consolidation are filled with tedium. Joyous tedium, of course, for under [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule, [Root.GetName] now stood atop all of Escann, but tedium nonetheless. No more sleepless nights, obsessing over army movements and frontlines. No more stressful meals, wondering whether an enemy mage would carve through the magical defenses and burst into the room in a lightning bolt of destruction. With a mind free to wander, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] thinking about Castanor, the greatest and first human empire on Cannor, often.

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.20.t;A Crisis of Identity;;
anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.21.a;Give full priority to restoring the trials!;;
anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.21.desc;The answer to the greatness and longevity of Castanor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had come to obsessively believe, were the mysterious Trials of Castan. Many specific details are vague, perhaps lost to the vagrancies of time, but accounts do agree on a few points. The Trials were a tradition started by Castan II 'Beastbane', seeking to follow in the Progenitor's footsteps. After summiting the Trialmount as Castan the Progenitor did, Beastbane added his own trial for every future Castan to complete, and so the tradition continued, with each successive Castan adding their own challenge to the mix. Only by proving one's worth in the ever more complicated Trials could one prove oneself worth of becoming the next Castan.\n\nAll this ended with War of the Sorcerer-King and the final Battle of Trialmount. It is said by many that the magical energies and destructive forces wrought by the battle forever tainted the Trialmount. At the very least, the battle rendered the mountain inaccessible for years after the battle. Stories of still-active magical traps, pockets of dark energy, and even echoes of ghostly appearances of the Sorcerer-King himself kept most out of the area, even as Castellyr and Escann started to consolidate and prosper in the centuries after the war. For the average person, the Trialmount and the Trials of Castan have long faded into history, banished from the public conscience by events since such as the Greentide and Wars of Escanni Consolidation.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] was not satisfied. Surely, some of the Trials would have survived. Surely, centuries of time would have dissipated the worst of the remaining dangers of the Trialmount. And most importantly, experiencing the Trials would surely open [Root.Monarch.GetName] up to the insight and wisdom of the greatest Castans, just by following in their steps!\n\nIn the meantime, Trialmount was overgrown. Glory Road was in disrepair, many of the paths leading from and to the disparate Trials had been swallowed by the hungry roots of trees, and the North Citadel was still a shadow of its former self without the old aqueduct feeding it. Before any could attempt the Trials of Castan again, they needed to be reclaimed from time and the wilds. While this was happening, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could devote all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time to pouring over ever last detail of each of the Castans and preparing for the trials.;;

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.22.desc;"Finally, the restoration of the Trials of Castan were complete! Before [Root.Monarch.GetName] could get too excited, however, a small contingent from the Castonath patricians, having gotten wind of the completion of the restoration, approaches. Certain patrician factions and families are more protective of Castanorian history and legacy than others, and this was clearly from one such family that took enormous pride in tracing their line directly from the very first Castanites. Proud and haughty as always, they quickly make their intentions known: they wish to dissuade [Root.Monarch.GetName] from attempting the Trials. They warn [Root.Monarch.GetName] of the dangers posed by the Trials, of the consequences of reigniting such a tradition in modern times, and above all, of soiling the legacy of Castanor. According to them, only those descending from Old Castanorian blood can rule, meaning that only those who share the blood of the original Castanites can become Castan. They cite the Proclamations of Castan, which states the following:\n""Henceforth all those that have followed and endured with me shall be known as MY people: Castanites - and our realm's successors will be of your blood and your blood alone.""\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] dismisses this out of hand of course, for had not the proclamation been broken by Castan Ebonfrost and his successors, who were all Gerudian?";;

anb_age_of_witch_kings;escanni_wars.3.d;Castanor began as a small power, centered on the fledgling city of Castonath. Castan the Progenitor was a local warlord at best, even if he had The Wayguide seer to help him, and was sufficiently talented to unite the Castanites behind him. And then, within a generation, Castan II 'Beastbane' was leading a crusade against the Deepwoods. A few more generations, and Castanor stood dominant in Cannor, only rivaled by the Gnomish Hierarchy and the Damerian Republic.\n\nIt seems another power in Escann has followed that path: [Root.GetName]. Rising from the ashes of the Greentide, by diplomatic dealings and military might they have rapidly secured control over a vast swathe of the region. Their rule over Escann is now incontestable, even if some pockets still resist them.\n\nOne question remains: what shall they do next. Shall they follow the footsteps of wise Castan IV 'Realmbuilder'? Bloodthirsty Castan IX 'the Quarreler'? Or will they be inspired more by Nichmer, the Sorcerer-King? Only time shall tell.;;

The eldest court is the Zhuying, and advocates for peace to facilitate growth of the internal economy. The Wandaoji came very soon after Jinqiu's founding, a court of eloquent and manipulative Jiangshi that frequently don elegant masks to hide their undead nature. The youngest court is that of the Shudiyi, consisting of former warlords and soldiers. They elect one of their exalted members to lead them for approximately two human generations, at which point the reigning Chancellor must step down and allow a member of one of the other Courts to take their place. They keep a tight grip on their subjects, using a combination of fear and mortal enforcers to ensure the loyalty of their country. Despite this, the staunchly meritocratic nature of their society opens the door for virtually anybody to rise to greatness, perhaps even being granted a seat at the council as a gift for their competence.;;

The Eunuchs argue that they were quite literally made for this, and that they can be trusted to value the future of our state above all else as they hold no other ties and can expect no other legacy. By contrast, the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ argue that their superior pedigree and connections to our nation's elite makes them a far more fitting choice than some insular courtiers.

anb_events;fey_alignment.14.d;The exchange of gifts is an ancient ritual, involving the sacrifice of a possession and the trust that you will receive in equal kindness. Even moreso than mortals, the Fey exchange gifts with such glee that would make children look like static and glum. Today you have received an anonymous gift.

And when rules are broken, those who made them respond gleefully. The Seelie Fey are reminding you of your debt to them, demanding far more than was given to you: the life of your child and heir must be theirs. Or, you could publicly humiliate yourself by admitting your avarice, announcing to all that you are one who can never be trusted and never gives back in return.

The meagre light helps little, but as you search you notice a shadow that should be illuminated.\n\nA voice calls out to you, cold and distant yet so very close. 'Finally awake. I thought it would be proper to inform you of my actions. Someone must be killed, someone of great value to you.

The gift of knighthood was by no means an everyday occurrence, and this time, the recipient was the crown heir [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]! The clank of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s boots echoed sharply across the stone floor, but even that became muffled as [Root.Monarch.GetName] steps on the vibrant and rich carpeting beneath the throne, kneeling. That uncomfortable position was to be [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s prison over the next quarter hour, as men and women of various import intoned on and on about the responsibilities and expectations of being a knight. Finally, the king rises up from the throne, and with a hint of a smile on his face, dramatically flourishes his sword. He taps each of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s shoulder gently, and beckons for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to rise up. The king envelops the new knight in a hug, as the silence is shattered by loud cheers and the clanging of metal against metal.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks back often to that proud day. It is a reminder of simpler times, before the old stresses of rulership had set in fully. Adenica had come a long way since that time, fully embodying the lofty ideals of chivalry and honor that the nation's founders had hoped to evoke by reviving the old feudal realm. And if [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] successors have any say, Adenica will continue to be a shining example of chivalry for centuries to come, standing stolid against the tyranny of witch-kings and keeping the old feudal traditions alive.;;

The werebear sits idly by a fire in human form, seemingly expecting this confrontation. Hands gripped tightly around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] quickly takes the werebear to task, demanding answers.\n\nThe half-man spins a sordid tale of circumstance. Apparently, he had been bitten and transformed almost by accident, having been a former herbalist. Lost in the woods one day looking for rare herbs, he had wandered into the territory of a particularly ornery fey, who then cursed him with lycanthropy. Unable to find succor in any civilized settlement, abandoned by even his family and driven from place to place, he was finally forced to this very location.

Flavour_Adenica_B58;flavor_adenica.51.d1;Reception among the more isolated marsh communities of Bal Mire and the surrounding lands was more muted than [Root.Monarch.GetName] was accustomed to. The ideals of Adean do not penetrate deep into the murky swamps, it seemed. All was not lost however, as a rickety old man approaches [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the end of the speech. Apparently, he had been an officer in his starry-eyed youth, eager to leave his dreary hometown behind before returning years later, disillusioned. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s words seem to have fired something up in him, however, and he offers his aid to Adenica.;;
Flavour_Adenica_B58;flavor_adenica.51.d2;Hundreds of small villages were dotted around the rolling plains of central Adenica, and these windswept clusters were what [Root.Monarch.GetName] meandered through next. These plains had borne some of the first great knights and mounted warriors of Escann, and it was easy to see why. Many of the villagers had been riding horses since their childhood years, and were as comfortable on a saddle as on their own two feet. Most would never be more than scouts, but every once in a while, a truly great rider would make their presence known.;;
Flavour_Adenica_B58;flavor_adenica.51.d3;Walking amongst the nobility was more akin to a regular feast than a recruitment drive, with drinks aplenty. The nobles individually pledged their loyal support enthusiastically, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that these promises were as transient as leaves in the wind. The time was not completely wasted however, as a group of the old guard gathered to talk logistics and strategy, lending their years of experience.;;
Flavour_Adenica_B58;flavor_adenica.51.d4;Oft neglected as second rate citizens despite being nominally accepted in Adenica, the reaction of the orcish communities to [Root.Monarch.GetName] was mixed.

As a vital trade link between Anbennar and lands of inner Escann and with all the wealth and access to raw materials that its location brought, industry was also starting to take hold of the city. Workshops and foundries, though lagging far behind their counterparts in Anbennar and the Alenic Reach, were nonetheless starting to pop up. And it was one of these workshops, specializing in making artillery pieces, that [Root.Monarch.GetName] would end up visiting. Adenica's knights, though devastatingly effective, were often stuck thinking in terms of old doctrine and the old traditions of waging war. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was looking for someone intimately familiar with gunpowder its uses and limitations, someone who could shake up the old order.;;

The scouts had figured out that the cockatrice was taking shelter on an old abandoned farmstead, only leaving to find food to bring back.\n\nThe hunting party approached the farmstead, excited to finally have something to do. Emboldened by the prospect of finishing the hunt, the party rushes into the dilapidated barn that housed the cockatrice before the more cautious members could stop them, hoping to catch the beast unawares. An unwelcome sight awaited [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Instead of a single cockatrice, the barn contained multitudes, likely the brood of the cockatrice. The scene quickly exploded into pandemonium, with retinue members hacking wildly as cockatrices take flight, aiming to either bite or flee.

The negative expression on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face evaporates in an instant, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally realizes what has happened. ""The weapon then, it is done?"" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] exclaims. ""Yes,"" the mage responds. ""The weapon, as you call it, is finished. Forged and warded by magic to be incredibly strong and able to transform into one of a few configurati -"" [Root.Monarch.GetName], barely listening, rushes out of the room. ""Get my riding gear!"", [Root.Monarch.GetName] shouts, as the castle bursts into activity.\n\nLater, an expanding group of generals, advisors, and confidants watches as [Root.Monarch.GetName] rides down yet another hapless block of hay. The bale explodes with some force as the lance impacts, as pieces of hay fly back from a small burst of magical energy. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] adjusts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] grip, the head of the lance subtly shifts into a sweeping edge, which [Root.Monarch.GetName] uses to decapitate several more hay blocks without losing a beat. ""I hope [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows that this thing will run out of energy soon,"" someone mutters from the crowd. And indeed, the lance seems to almost fade by a few grades, settling back into the form of a long stick as [Root.Monarch.GetName] wheels back around. ""How long until we can make more of these things!"" [Root.Monarch.GetName] whoops as the crowd shies back. It would have to be recharged periodically with magical energy and certainly was not even near what the precursors had accomplished with the legendary Calindal, but three years of effort and collaboration had finally yielded a weapon worthy of the knight-kings of Adenica.";;

She is old enough to remember when the Dookan first came to her in a vision, letting her know of his son's coming. She is old enough to remember when she first laid eyes on Korgus, and knew immediately that he was the Dookan's chosen child. She is old enough to remember when the Dookanson chose her as his personal shaman, and commanded her to spread the word of his coming to the rest of the orcs. She is old enough to remember the start of the Greentide, when thousands upon thousands of orcs spilled out into Escann, seeking victory and glory for the Dookan and his son... And seeking a better life for themselves and all of the orcish race, away from the poverty of the Dwarovar. And she is old enough to remember when Korgus fell, the true child of her beloved Dookan, slain by the human Corin.\n\nGrama Clouded Eye is old enough to remember all of that... And is old enough to know that her time to pass into the arms of the Great Dookan is fast approaching.;;

anb_events;flavor_clouded_eye.2.d;She is dead. The woman who was said to have spoken directly with the Great Dookan himself in her visions, is dead. The woman who once insulted Varok Bladebreaker to his face and lived to tell the tale, is dead. The woman who rallied the disparate clans and tribes to the Dookanson's call, is dead. Grama Clouded Eye is dead, and the entire clan mourns.\n\nIt was as she lay on her death bed that she finally chose who her successor as clan chief would be. She had said that the Great Dookan himself had pointed out three exceptional young orcs to her in a vision, each exemplifying his strength in a different way, and each of which would be powerful clan chiefs in their own right.\n\nBagrum was no great warrior, and was often ridiculed by other orcs supposedly cowering behind defenses of his own construction. However, the Great Dookan knows that strength does not come only from a blade or a club. The other orcs stopped laughing at Bagrum once he saved them from a deadly charge of Cannorian knights with defenses he had hidden in the tall grass. The Dookan's children must have homes to live in and walls to protect themselves, and Bagrum would build those for his people.\n\nMeshug had always been considered soft by the other orcs. Whereas most of the Dookanson's followers were content to raid and pillage, Meshug found no satisfaction in such actions. Instead, Meshug spent hours in his tent, creating all of the things that other orcs simply stole from the lands they conquered. Why would Meshug waste so much time and effort making things, the other orcs asked, when he could just take them? Because, Meshug said, the Great Dookan is glorified not just in victorious battle, but in hard work, as well, in productive labor, to make life better for all of his children.\n\nKrunaka is the strongest warrior in Clouded Eye, able to best any male with ease. Unlike most orcs, though, Krunaka does not fight for the honor of the glory of it. No... Krunaka fights for peace. Other orcs laugh at her for it, of course. An orc that wants peace? What sort of orc is that? The Great Dookan, however, understands the strength that comes in peace, and would see Krunaka defeat the orcs' enemies and end decades of war and death.\n\nNo matter who Grama chose as her successor, the Clouded Eye clan would follow, for shaman's word was taken to be the word of the Great Dookan himself, whom none of the orcs would oppose. Who will Grama choose as the next clan chief?;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.12.d;It is time to erect a building capable of defying the heavens. May our wards be strong, and our incantations unshakable, for we will need all the strength of the celestial planes to accomplish this task.;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.13.a;Let's bring the heavens down.;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.13.d;We are finally ready. After many years of work, we have set up a complex maze of wards and enchantments, ready to welcome the most powerful incantations of our most powerful magicians. The culmination of a decade of effort will finally pay off.;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.16.d;The largest metropolis on the continent, Anbennc?st stands proudly on our border, welcoming every ship to Dameshead. The strategic position, the economic value, and the cultural heritage of this city do not allow it to remain without a master powerful enough to guarantee its independence. As undisputed leader of the Damesear, it is our duty to present to the Emperor our candidacy as guardian of the city of cities.;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.17.b;Never!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.17.d;With the support of the emperor, the Magisterium claims our independence. Should we accept this proposal, or refuse this ultimatum?;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.2.d;With the logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the expedition. While some prefer to use large detection spells in order to spot any suspicious mechanism in the flooded area, others believe that sweeping the surrounding swamps and submerged land using a huge labor supply will bring better results.;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.2.t;Diverging Opinions;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.20.a;Mine them all!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.20.d;Our wizards were right, and under the Moonmount there was indeed a huge amount of precious stones. Although their purity is not the best, it remains sufficient to ensure income and materials for our projects.;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.21.a;Corin is the true successor to Castellos.;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.21.b;Castellos' son shall lead the Regent Court.;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.21.d;There is heavy debate among the magisters as to what to do about the recent upheaval of the Regent Court pantheon. Many magisters have come back from Escann after fighting in the Greentide, providing the majority of the support for placing Corin as the successor to Castellos. Other more traditional magisters, many of the same ones that forbid magisters leaving to fight the Greentide in the first place, still believe that Castellos' son Adean should be their next leader.\n\nAfter much deliberation, taking part over multiple days, the council has decided:;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.21.t;Corinite Debate;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.3.a;Forward!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.3.d;What first looked like a large stone rising to the sky was actually an obelisk of unknown material, marking the location of a partially flooded underpass. Animated by a second wind after months of excavation, the expedition has begun to quickly unearth the secrets of this passage.;;

Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.4.a;All these efforts finally pay off;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.4.d;What at first looked like a huge and dilapidated black room has been revealed to be a huge cache, filled with pristine treasures! Galvanized, the expedition picked up again, until they lifted the veil on a huge tomb, apparently belonging to an old and powerful mage... whose skeletal remains suggest elven bearing?!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.4.t;Mage Tomb;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.5.a;Onward!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.5.d;Within the marsh itself, there are a myriad of stinky charms, punctuated in the peat that appears as the area is emptied of any form of moisture. The permanent relay of various teams of mages and mowers finally revealed an entire part of the sunken city. Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, caught the attention of the expedition, which is now directing all its efforts towards this strange building.;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.5.t;Swamp of Sorrows;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.6.a;Success!;;
Flavour_Magisterium_A85;flavor_magisterium.6.d;We quickly pierced the entrance of this strange, temple-seeming building, and disabled its magic golems. It has turned out to actually be a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosities dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics. At first glance, our leading historians suggest that the precursors may have been experimenting on the native Halanni humans?!;;

The blast of the explosion destroyed all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, and defying the beauty of the most beautiful women in Halann.;;

Excitement takes over his face and he jumps up and gestures at the damestear pommel of the captain's swords and then urges him to follow. He leads the men to a nearby village and brings them to his elder. After talking to him and gesturing to the sword the elder starts to speak. One of the translators steps forward and says: ""He asks if we have been to the Glowing City, if it has risen again."" ""Maybe he talks about the city from the temple. Ask him what he knows.""

But every matching detail from the elder's story strengthens their trust and therefore their will to march on. Suddenly they run into a strangely barren circle with a ruin on a hill in the middle. Nothing grows within the circle, there is only plain dirt. Even the clouds seem to pass around this place. As the first men step into the circle they feel like walking through a waterfall. On the other side they are met with total silence. Not a single sound from either the wildlife or the rest of their group can be heard.

Panicked shouts from the deep alerts the adventure captain and his guard. As they draw their weapons and approach the men they nearly fall into a pit full of bones. The men stare down upon what seems to be the remains of hundreds, not only men, but women and children too. Someone carved crude elven words into the wall: ""Here rests the murder of Aesair (sky city). Slaughtered by those too blind to see.""

anb_precursor_fragment;fragments.2.d;It is said that in a time before the Precursor Empire… was an age known as The Rule of Dragons.\n\nA time where the elven people were slaves to the Dragon Scions, who warred amongst themselves for hegemony over Aelantir... until a member of the Dragonguard, elite warrior-slaves taught magic to fight on their master's behalf, decided to act – killing their draconic master. This hero was known as Venaan, who is said to be the originator of the word ‘elven' in the first place (meaning of Venaan), and with his act of defiance more and more Dragonguard began to overthrow and kill their masters, leading to mass rebellion across Aelantir.\n\nWith magic harnessed by the Dragonguard and the will of the elven slaves across the continent, the tyrannous dragons were beaten and wiped to near extinction: the rest were said to be cursed to become mindless beasts and wander the world… except one.\n\nAmadian myth speak of ancient warriors who fought to protect their ‘scaled master' from ‘a war of bonds'. It is said these ancient warriors appeared once again with their master during the Day of Ashen Skies, and rescued those they deemed ‘pure of heart' to take to the master's hidden realm.\nLike most stories, it shows a grain of truth – but our mages have confirmed that the magical auras in Amadia seem to concentrate at some parts of the region one day, and the next, disappear. If this is this alleged realm of the last dragon the legends speak of, who knows what knowledge and riches we could find?;;"Гoвopят, чтo вo вpeмeнa, пpeдшecтвoвaвшиe импepии-пpeдшecтвeнницeЗ былa эпoxa, извecтнaя кaк Эpa Пpaвлeния Дpaкoнoв.\n\nBpeмя, кoгдa эльфийcкий нapoд был paбaми дpaкoньиx oтпpыcкoв, кoтopыe вoeвaли мeжду coбoй зa гeгeмoнию нaд AэлaнтиpoмЗ пoкa члeн Дpaкoньeй cтpaжи, элитный вoин-paб, oбучeнный мaгии cpaжaтьcя oт имeни cвoeгo xoзяинa, нe peшил дeйcтвoвaть-убить дpaкoнa.

anb_precursor_fragment;fragments.202.d;A surge of magic has been detected in $PROVINCENAME$. From a layman's eyes it was nothing but a large clearing in the jungle, but to us: it was proof. It seems our observation posts did not simply track this alleged hidden realm, but also tampered with the stability of its movements – and caused something to leave tracks. The soil was not of this region. The rocks were scattered as if thrown by force in all directions, but most importantly… a single spear found buried in the ground.\n\nThe spear was clearly more advanced than the ruinborn were capable of. When shown to archaeologists they could see clear precursor origins, but they noted that some parts of the spear were newer than the rest. The shaft was made of strange wood unlike any we've seen in Amadia, and was dated to be only ten years old. The spearhead was much older, of course, and bore the mark of precursor steel, but with one caveat: it had the signs of frequent care.\n\nBut the most important thing was what the mages said: it had a strange lingering scent of magic. One that was not of this plane. What we do with this spear will no doubt determine our success.;;Bcплecк мaгии был oбнapужeн в $PROVINCENAME$.\nC тoчки зpeния нeпpoфeccиoнaлa, этo былa вceгo лишь бoльшaя пoлянa в джунгляx, нo для нac этo былo дoкaзaтeльcтвoм.

anb_precursor_fragment;fragments.205.d;"In what used to be a stretch of jungle was now a valley that looked like Amadia before the Ruin. A large paved path stretched across the valley to the top, with humble stone houses dotted by the roadside. At the very end of the road, up a mountain, was a grand palace with huge gates that welcomed all sorts of life in, and presumably, allowed a dragon to fly out.\nThe valley, however was empty. The houses looked lived in, but there was no one to be seen. Had they fled? It didn't matter. The looting had already begun, and large contingents of our explorers began to enter the houses and carry back treasures to safer lands.\nOur main group crept their way to the palace and were greeted by the temple guards, who bore armour resembling those of the ancient Dragonguard that once liberated Aelantir. But behind them, was a sight that stunned the adventurers. A dragon. Shiny and crimson, sprawled across the span of the entire palace floor.\n\nThe scaled beast spoke, and with each word, the land itself shook. ""I bid you entrance to my haven, in hopes of answering your curiosity. But now I see I have been mistaken,"" the beast continued, and looked at one of our ruinborn guides. ""For my people, the disaster has only been a hundred years ago, yet you bear the scars of a time beyond that. I pity you. For what your ancestors had done to my people, and what your ancestors have done to the world."" The beast then returned its gaze to our explorer. ""By temporarily binding my realm to yours, I have seen what fate has befallen the world, to Druzbhazinl, and I want nothing to do with it. SO BEGONE!""\n\nWith fiery breath most of our adventurers were extinguished, and those that were lucky managed to make it back out of the valley, and not a second later, it was gone, and the jungle returned to its place.";;"Taм, гдe paньшe были джунгли, тeпepь былa дoлинa, пoxoжaя нa Aмaдeю дo pуин.

Eventually, you find a place to hide, sinking yourself near the edge an enclosed lake to the point of almost drowning.\n\nAs the night passes, sounds of merriment and laughter become deafeningly loud, as if there was a party right next to you. In the noise, you swear you could pick out the voice of one of your companions. Were they alright? No. Surely a trick. In an attempt to block out the noise, you put on the green knight's helm...\n\nThe next time you wake, you are greeted with silence. It feels cold now, and dry. Taking the helm off, you realize you're back in the forests of Old Rzentur. You return back to civilization with stories to tell, and the helm as your only momento of another world.\n\nYou would return to Old Rzentur one day, many years from now, hoping to find that same tree, but you never do. You settle with a local tribe and live out your days, like the prince in the story before you.;;Oднo-eдинcтвeннoe дepeвo. Pacкoл мeжду двумя миpaми. Ha oднoй пoлoвинe-жизнь и вибpaция.

The murals in the same ruins revealed that Castellos was Castellar, a precursor god, also stretched back to the origins of elvenkind.\n\nIt depicts the ancient elves in chains, bound to their draconic overlords, and later on, shows the elves breaking free from those bonds – confirming The War of Broken Chains that the elves of Cannor speak about in their traditional tales. But the section after that is what interests us: an image of elves gathered round in a chamber, clasping hands around a central source of power. Within that source of power, a strange diamond-like symbol.\n\nThis key symbol appears very little in the precursor texts we have seen, but following any traces of it may lead to a greater understanding behind the rise of the Precursor Empire.;;Oткpытиe, чтo Kacтeллoc мepтв, пoтpяcлo Kaннop дo глубины души, нo c этим oткpытиeм мы узнaли бoльшe o тoм, кaк фopмиpoвaлacь caмa Импepия Пpeдтeч.

The previous speaker appears to be singing. His voice rises from the monitor, clear and strong, as though he were right in front of us. The words are untranslatable, even for Cela, but their haunting melody sends a shiver down our spines. When the song ends, the monitor crackles briefly, then falls silent.\n\nWhere could these sounds have come from? Could there be Precursors that remain somewhere out there, hidden away in a Vault of some sort, having survived the Ruin of Aelantir?

We were reluctant at first, but after one of the Epednar elders heard of our quest, he produced a ""singing crystal"" - and what songs it sings! According to the Epednar, these ""singing crystals"" seem to be constantly repeating, and are a symbol of the cycle of death and rebirth. That's not the most important thing, however. This crystal is clearly receiving the same messages as Orbin's aetheric monitor!

It appears that the events narrated on Orbin's aetheric monitor took place a long time ago. The Vault may contain untold riches, true - but it is a graveyard for the elves that once resided within it, who slaughtered each other over meaningless trifles.

What this pillar is, and what it represents, we have no way of knowing, but it's prevalence in this text seems to imply at least some importance to the Precursors. And of course, what the precursors see as important, must surely also be valuable!\n\nSome, however, have doubts, and more than a few members of our expedition are reluctant to go searching for a place that may not even exist, and even if it did exist, may not hold anything of value whatsoever.";;"Koгдa нaши иccлeдoвaтeли в Aэлeнтиpe пpoдoлжaют cвoe путeшecтвиe пo дpeвним pуинaм, oни нaтыкaютcя нa тo, чтo кaжeтcя дpeвним бopтoвым жуpнaлoм, пo-видимoму, пpeднaзнaчeнным для oтcлeживaния paзличныx лoгиcтичecкиx oпepaций пo вceй Импepии Пpeдтeч.

anb_precursor_fragment;fragments.601.d;Our search for the Pillar has borne no fruit, with no sign of the ancient tower. Until now, that is. The Ruinborn of $PROVINCENAME$, when our translator mentioned the Pillar whilst passing through their village, seemed to instantly warm up to us, greeting us as friends. It turns out, amongst local tales, the Pillar is meant to be their gateway to the afterlife, where the souls of the departed ascend to the heavens. They describe the tower as an endless pillar, ascending higher than the clouds, higher than the heavens themselves, higher even than the realms of the gods, to reach a series of paradises spread across the sky.\n\nIn addition, from what we gather based on many loose interpretations of Ruinborn religious texts, the Pillar seems to have been some sort of tower that served as a main logistical hub for the ancient elves, with mythologised versions of goods such as gemstones, food, damestear, magical scrolls, and various other items all seeming to pass through the tower at some point or another.;;Haши пoиcки cтoлбa нe пpинocили никaкиx peзультaтoв.

anb_precursor_fragment;fragments.603.d3;It seems that following the trail of rubble has been a wild success! Although it was a long trek, as we continued, be it every few days or even weeks apart, we would always eventually see more chunks of marble rubble, confirming we were headed in the right direction. Almost like an Escanni fey-tale, it seems that this trail of rubble has led us in exactly the right direction to the Pillar! \n\nAs we reached ever closer to our quest's end, however, the very landscape around us seemed to become… stranger. Our expedition began noticing plants that we had never seen before, some with roots that every so often burst out of the soil, as if rejecting it, some with leaves containing images of what appeared to be screaming faces, and a tree that seemed to be able to move so long as no one was looking. As we continued, a sense of unease began to permeate throughout the expedition, until eventually, not only were our fears confirmed, our nightmares were made real. \nFrom seemingly out of nowhere, our expedition was ambushed by a pack of nightmarish beasts, with an almost otherworldly appearance. They appeared to be griffon-like in nature, with their furred bodies and four legs, but where there should have been wings, there were instead two massive, flailing, octopus-like tentacles. Where there should have been a tail, there was instead a stinger, like that of a bee, and where there should have been a face, there was only a single, gaping, roaring, maw.\nThe fighting was bloody, and many in our expedition were lost, but eventually, all of the twisted beasts were slain. All, that is, but one. Our expedition's leader managed to pin one down, and eventually restrain it with magical chains. The question now remains, what to do with the beast? No matter what we do with it, however, it seems almost certain that the Pillar is close.;;Пoxoжe, чтo идти пo cлeду oблoмкoв былo вepным peшeниeм!

In the north, survival depends on the cooperation of the whole community to survive the harsh winters. Our society as it has entered a relatively feudal state has preserved the close bonds of the community, with the nobility often being non-hereditary and being semi-elected rulers. As a consequence the nobility are both weak and connected with the commoners, and the commoners themselves are less oppressed than other lands.;;Гepудия издaвнa былa cтpaнoй, гдe пpocтoлюдины пoльзoвaлиcь oтнocитeльнo эгaлитapными зaкoнaми и пpaвaми, нaчинaя c тex днeй, кoгдa нaш нapoд cocтoял из нeбoльшиx бpoдячиx гpупп.

anb_events;golden_highway.1.da;The first steps in the restoration of the golden highway in [Root.GetName] have been made. Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. The foundations have been restored where they still existed and built anew where time had wiped them away entirely. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. With more time and effort the roads of Jaher will be returned to their former glory and we will reap the benefits. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further funding to continue the project.;;Пepвыe шaги пo вoccтaнoвлeнию Зoлoтoгo Пути в [Root.GetName] были cдeлaны.

anb_formable_countries;orcform.3.d;"The invitation arrived at the old Ziggurat in Azka-Sur just as the sun was setting, words written in a shakey hand, but with a clear message: a delegation of priests was requested by the orcs who had recently spilled into Bulwar. The purpose could not quite be made out, but the repeated promises of safety ameliorated the priesthood's worries. And so a handful of junior priests departed, riding some of the Kingdom's least-valuable horses.\n\nAs the emissaries approached, at roughly Noon, they saw a field of silver and black waiting outside [Root.Capital.GetName] — thousands upon thousands of Black Orcs, armor-clad, arrayed around a small hill. The priests looked askance at one another, but none wanted to be the first to suggest cowardice, and so they slowly nudged their steeds towards this convocation.\n\nThe envoys neared, having to force their mounts along — especially when the orcs started to beat their weapons against one another, and parted ranks to let them through. Each polished blade flickered, illuminated in the high Noon sun. Swallowing their fear and their bewilderment, the delegation continued through the throng, towards the figure at its center.\n\nThat figure: a tall orc, skin as black as night, a sharp contrast to the golden crown gleaming in his hands. He gestures the delegation to stop, and its leader dismounts. The orc briefly closes his eyes, nods. He steps forward, places the crown in the Dartaxi priest's hands, and kneels before him. The noise all around suddenly ceases, the land goes quiet, all Bulwar seeming to hold its breath.\n\nThat priest has been in his position only a few years, in the priesthood less than a decade. What could he say? What could he do, aside from the obvious? And so with trembling hands he places the crown on the chieftain's head. A moment passes, two. And then the orc rises, the silence is broken. Every orc chants a single world: ""Karakal! Karakal! Karakal!""";;

It is clear that we have reached a new level of mastery over metal, and correspondingly, that our inventions have reached a new level of mastery over war. But there is bickering between every forge about how our designs may be specialized. Some favour cannons that can be well-integrated with our foot soldiers, arguing that such cannons would be more easily defended and could also cover their advance. Others favour more destructive weapons, that we may rain fire from above and see our enemies blown to bits. Both will require a great deal of focus and craftsmanship, and our choice will define the Kanzadi guns, and consequently dwarven guns, for the centuries to come. It is time for the Lord of Amber to make a decision.;;Был coзвaн Coвeт пушeчныx Kузнeцoв.

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.1.d;While we'd not thought much of [This.GetName]'s hinterland, it seems that the hubris of our dismissal had been a grave mistake. Recent surveying efforts in the region have revealed a mysterious, ancient, and exquisitely designed ruin, further inspection dating it back to the time of the Precursors. \n\nA few of our people have had to be taught the lesson of not sticking every unknown object one finds in an ancient ruin into their pockets, and the site has mostly been secured to prevent any further incidents of theft or injuries from the often-volatile properties of these relics. Our experts are at the ready, primed to set up a proper dig and delve if the word is given. Should we see to it that these items are secured and put to proper use?;;B якoбы зaтepяннoм мecтe пpoвинции [This.GetName] мы oбнapужили дpeвниe pуины эльфoв-пpeдшecтвeнникoв, дaтиpуeмыe зaдoлгo дo нaшeй эpы!

And, yet, it seems that simply wasn't enough time to leave the amount of relics that the world now clamors for. The ruin in [This.GetName] has proved bountiful and illuminating. Our crew on the ground has brought us concerning news, however. The site is growing barer by the day, our digs moving further and further from the exhausted abundance of the site's center. \n\nThis isn't the end, but we can hear rumblings that the site may soon be exhausted.;;Пpoдoлжaющaяcя экcплуaтaция и тopгoвля peликвиями, нaйдeнными в [This.GetName] пoлнocтью ocушилa pуины эльфoв-пpeдшecтвeнникoв.

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.3.d;Looking terribly sheepish, the leaders of our excavation at the Precursor ruins in [This.GetName] have come knocking with the most unfortunate news. Though they've kept digging for weeks now, they've yet to turn up more than a pittance of pottery, a few loose bones, and enough worms to give a small city's worth of people a nice fishing trip. Simply put, the ruin is ruined. We've picked it clean of anything valuable, turned every stone, and used it to the last. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems our investments in the province will have to be redirected to some other industry. Let's hope we can muster something to give even a fraction of the relics' worth.;;

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.4.d;Previously the domain of a few cloistered scholars in far-flung corners of the world, and hardly worthy of note outside the tales of particularly prestigious items such as the blade Calindal, the neglect of Precursor relics has finally come to an end. With the widespread awareness of their utility, a permanent trade in these curios of the past has been established for years now, and is quickly transforming these items from a valuable commodity to a rarity. \n\nMany of the first and most noteworthy deposits of relics have begun to run dry, and the world has begun to scramble for new sources. This, however, has been quite a profitable panic, as the trade has only become more lucrative in recent months, and should only grow more profitable from here.;;Пocтoяннaя тopгoвля peликвиями пpeдшecтвeнникoв oбeднилa pынoк, увeличив иx peдкocть, и в тo жe вpeмя...

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.5.d;While the world has for some time now been aware of the depletion of Precursor sites, such news has become more common and pronounced, with sites in all four corners of the world being greatly diminished, or exhausted entirely. Though some sites had been mostly inaccessible, and helped to alleviate this anxiety, the climbing prices have made even the most remote deposits viable. \n\nIt's clear the world will soon see the peak of its supply, as the squabbles between the historians, mages, and artificers who all wish to put the relics to their own ends grow more bitter and acrid. Though the prices are still rising, giving a boon to the state, it's clear that soon, most everyone will simply have to make do without relics.;;C гoдaми peликвии пocтeпeннo тepяютcя в миpe, в тo вpeмя кaк мecтa, гдe иx pacкoпки пpoдoлжaютcя, мнoжaтcя.

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.6.d;This obsession with digging up the past to chart our future seems like it soon may be a thing of the past. Only the grandest or most remote ruins still continue to yield relics of the Precursors' empire, with many of their finer examples long since broken down for study, or confined to the collections of those who simply refuse to be bribed for them, or are too powerful for unseemly folk to pilfer from. Most every self-respecting mage or artificer would give almost anything to get their hands on these relics, but even the wealthiest among them struggle to secure more than a pittance of useless baubles for their efforts. \n\nThose lucky few who hold the coinpurses for the remaining excavations will doubtlessly be endowed with abundant, vulgar wealth. The question remains, though, how long until the foundations of their businesses have become as much a relic as those artefacts?;;Пocкoльку дo cиx пop paбoтaeт лишь нecкoлькo pacкoпoк, cпpoc нa peликвии пoлнocтью oпepeжaeт пpeдлoжeниe, чтo пpивoдит к пoвышeнию цeн, в тo вpeмя кaк нeмнoгиe лopды и тopгoвцы, вce eщe cтoящиe вo глaвe учacткa, видят, кaк иx кapмaны нaпoлняютcя.

anb_precursorrelics;precursor_relics.9.d;In years past, Precursor Relics had been nothing but a curiosity, their origin veiled in mystery, the power they contained stunning and inexplicable. Fortunately, with the rediscovery of Aelantir and the formalized study and interest in them, a greater understanding has grown and spread through all the world. With a contextualization of these items in the history of the Precursor Elves' empire, they are now merely stunning and nearly inexplicable. \n\nStretching the limits of magical possibility, these common items blow past the finest mages and tinkerers alike in their ability to provide solutions to problems. At least, when we can figure out what exactly they were for. Whether for their brilliant applications of known principles, strange effects that are contradictory to our understanding of the natural world and laws of magic, or simply the prestige of holding the legacy of the world's greatest empire, the price of these relics has lit the markets ablaze. \n\nMore importantly, it will put those who control the relics in the perfect position to part the world's political and intellectual elite with an exorbitant amount of money.;;Cнaчaлa любoпытcтвo, зaтeм oбщecтвeннoe явлeниe и пoвтopнoe oткpытиe Aэлaнтиpa пpoбудилo ocoбую жaжду к peликвиям пpeдшecтвeнникoв, cпpoc нa кoтopыe paзгopaeтcя пo вceму миpу.

But, with the Age of Unraveling, these relics came to be commonly known as the last remnants of the world-spanning empire of the Precursor elves. \n\nDisplaying an unrivaled magical prowess that far surpasses our own capabilities, these curios are keys to the past and blueprints for the future.;;Эльфы-пpeдшecтвeнники кoгдa-тo пpaвили Aэлaнтиpoм и ocтaльным миpoм c пoмoщью нeпpeвзoйдeннoй мaгичecкoй cилы, нo вce, чтo ocтaлocь oт ниx-этo pуины, a тaкжe бeздeлушки и apтeфaкты, кoтopыe мы мoжeм извлeчь из ниx.

In recent years, however, its staff have neglected to do their jobs. We must restore Rahen's damaged infrastructural networks and appease the farmers and labourers upon whose produce the Ministry depends. With their assent, we will be able to conduct a conclusive administrative overhaul and reform the Ministry of Agriculture.;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahen_reform_ministry_of_internal_relations_desc;The Ministry of Internal Relations keeps the various Prahhia and Senaptia of the Raj quiescent, and allows Rahen to act as one unified entity, with one voice and one mind. However, the Ministry has become decadent, and our sovereignty and supremacy within the Raj is no longer as respected as it once was. This must change. By ensuring that our subjects do not fight one another, and by quashing any and all rebellions that arise, we will restore our legitimacy and in so doing free ourselves to reform the Ministry of Internal Relations.;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.0.a;We need reform!;;Haм нужны peфopмы
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.0.d;Since the reign of Golpalar I, the bureaucracy of the Harimraj has been growing more and more powerful and corrupt. A series of weak rulers, civil wars, and plagues have decimated the power and authority of the Raja. Now, 50 years of poor management of what was once the greatest empire in Haless has come to a head. The elderly Raja Indranayar has little control over his state - his feuding subjects war with one another to consolidate their power, the ministerial bureaucrats embezzle money and land while abdicating their responsibilities, and the army is a fraction of its former size and power.\n\nThe only major asset of the government is the brilliant young Grand Vizier, Manava of the Bloody Claw, Senapti of Rabhidaraj. An administrative genius, Manava’s policies and backroom dealings with powerful ministers have so far kept the government from spiraling into total collapse - but the efforts of one man cannot stave off disaster forever. Dark days loom ahead for the Second Harimraj, and if the court is not heavily reformed, the Raj faces a continual downward spiral until it is ultimately overthrown by one of its many power-hungry subjects. Plans must be laid and preparations swiftly made if the Harimraj is to survive the coming years.;;Двop Paджa cтaнoвилcя вce бoлee мoгущecтвeнным и кoppумпиpoвaнным.

This has allowed certain unsavoury individuals to use the Library as a convenient storage-place for evidence of their misdeeds. We have therefore ordered a raid on the Archives.

The offending ministers have been taken into custody and await execution for their brazen corruption and betrayal of the trust placed in them and their office. This will certainly send a message about how the Raj treats those who abuse their office, and help us continue to build our case against more powerful High Ministers who yet avoid the grasp of the hand of justice. ;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.123.t;Raid on Ministerial Estate Cracks Down on Corruption;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.150.a;The Ministry of Agriculture grows once more!;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.150.d;Once, the Ministry of Agriculture managed Rahen's most vital industry: the cultivation of plants and livestock for consumption and sale. Its ministers were agronomists par excellence, and its libraries were among the best in the world for those seeking new and exciting methods to maintain the fertility of their fields. The Ministry had a monopoly on the sale and distribution of foodstuffs, and administered an immense number of granaries and warehouses. Over the past century, however, that function fell into disrepair. The irrigation systems that had kept the Raj fertile atrophied, with some being torn apart in times of war by invading armies, while the lower castes were oppressed by the very bureaucrats who had once sworn to protect them and uphold their interests.\n\nNo longer! Through deliberate and concerted action, Raja [Root.Monarch.GetName] has reformed the Ministry of Agriculture from its formerly decrepit state. The rents, incomes, fees and tariffs that had once been farmed out by disinterested and venal ministers have been returned to the control of the Lotus Court, and our farmers labour placidly on the fields, safe in the knowledge that there is once more a benevolent eye overseeing their work. With this intricate system restored to its proper functioning, we may now move on other, greater matters.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.150.t;Reformation of the Ministry of Agriculture;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.151.a;The Ministry of Foreign Relations shall continue to discharge its original function.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.151.d;Once, the Ministry of Foreign Relations managed the Harimraj's interactions with the rest of the world. An elaborate system of diplomatic protocol and tradition ensured that the Raja's interests were observed and respected across Haless, and our ambassadors were treated with the utmost courtesy. However, the Ministry has grown corrupt over the past century. Our ambassadors became decadent, and regularly made fools of themselves in foreign courts, dragging our reputation through the mud. Most damningly, our fecklessness permitted the emergence of a monstrous power in our backyard - the Command.\n\nNo longer! We have begun once again to look outwards, ending decades of self-absorption and isolation. Our envoys have been whipped into shape, and the orderly rhythm of diplomacy has resumed once more. Royal marriages are being concluded, the Raja is referred to with the appropriate respect, and our prestige is no longer at rock-bottom. With our relations with the rest of the world once more on an even keel, we may proceed on to weightier matters...;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.151.t;Reformation of the Ministry of Foreign Relations;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.152.a;A house divided against itself cannot stand, but we will be divided no longer.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.152.d;"While the other ministries dealt obliquely with our multifarious subjects, the Ministry of Internal Relations tackled the situation head-on. An immense machine comprising thousands of salaried clerks and administrators, it had a staggering amount of influence over our relationships with our subjects, controlling the arenas within which our Senaptia and Prabhia sparred and jockeyed for power. When it was running smoothly, the Raj was quiescent; peace ruled the land, and all was well. In recent years, however, the bureaucrats of the Ministry grew greedy and jealous, and believed that they - and not the Raja - knew what was best for the Raj. Their machinations weakened our legitimacy amongst our subjects, and caused their faith in our leadership to falter for a brief time. Internal conflict was on the verge of becoming commonplace.\n\nThis disaster was averted, however. On the Raja's initiative, the Ministry has undergone a comprehensive overhaul, and proper order has been restored. Our subjects, who once entertained thoughts of rebellion, have been disabused of such improper notions. The Raj is once again stable, and our grip on it stronger than ever. With our house in order, we may now redirect our gaze to other issues...";;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.153.a;The Ministry of Philosophy emerges, renewed!;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.153.d;The smallest of the four ministries but no less important despite this, the learned scholar-librarians of the Ministry of Philosophy provide the legal basis for all of the laws promulgated by the Lotus Court. It is they who tend to the diverse intellectual traditions of Rahen and the Raj, maintaining the heft and strictures and tenets and elegant turns of phrase that have characterised High Philosophy for centuries. Our servants grew indolent, however, and began prizing cleverness over wisdom. They became liabilities to the Raj rather than assets, and wasted their salaries on good food and earthly pleasures instead of on valuable scrolls and stationery. Without them, our subjects were bereft of guidance, and misrule was sure to follow.\n\nFortunately, we stepped in at the last minute, before things degenerated past the point of no return. Rightly have we purged the Ministry of Philosophy, consigning hundreds of decadent bureaucrats to the dungeons after publicising evidence of their many misdeeds. Few remained true to the initial purpose of the Ministry to which they belonged, and the Raja found it necessary to reconstitute it from scratch, relying on those who remained and designating thousands of scholars as aspirants. It was an immense task, but nothing is impossible if one has sufficient dedication. With this pillar of our government thus reconstituted, we may redirect our attention to other business...;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2112.d;We heard, vaguely, that one of the Vizier's sons was visiting court, but thought little of it until the Vizier approached the Lotus Throne himself, head bowed. Apparently, said son has proven talented with both spear-play and tactical thinking, and the vizier would have him serve our armies. When the man is brought to introduce himself, he does seem promising -- but also undoubtedly loyal to our Vizier, first and foremost. A sharp sword indeed, but one that would be close to the Raja himself, with all the risk that entails.\n\nWhat shall the Raja decide?;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2113.b;This is unimportant, they deserve not an ounce further of thought.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2113.d;Among the countless subjects that pay the Raja homage in [4411.GetName] is a small herd of elephants -- part of the Ghavanaaji tribes' historical tribute and cared for as a sign of the Raja's prestige (and occasionally, when there are Reishi around, used for parades or hunting). [Root.Monarch.GetName] has paid them little heed, until [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] encounter today.\n\nIn [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] customary stroll through the Lotus Court's outlying gardens, during which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks through all the myriad problems of the Harimraj, the day was utterly disrupted when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] trod into a large pile of elephant feces. Looking up in disgust and disbelief, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] barely dodged the swing of a massive trunk.\n\nIf this insult was offered by any human to the Harimraj's second-highest figure, they would face immediate execution. But, alas, the law is unclear when it comes to the elephants. Any response would have to go through Raja [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName]. And if there is no punishment, that'll indicate to the court -- who seemed to learn of the event in an hour -- where the vizier falls in the Raja's esteem.;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2114.d;[Root.Monarch.GetName] has long admired [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] small herd of elephants, a tribute from the Ghavanaaji and sign of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prestige. That said, one of the perks of being Raja is that such a possession does not require [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] think of the beasts' care, or feeding, or exercise. Indeed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] little thinks of them at all -- until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] heard of today's hilarious, scandalous, event.\n\nApparently, the vizier stepped in elephant dung on a walk today, and was almost trunk-slapped by one of the creatures. They are now demanding the execution of the offending elephant, and the trainers who abetted this 'crime'. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cannot think of the last time [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] so red in anger and embarrassment -- but, as with any act from the Lotus Court, levying a punishment on these great beasts would have repercussions around the Harimraj.\n\nThe Raja here is judge, jury, and (metaphorical) executioner -- what is the sentence?;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2115.d;No matter the school, one tenet that unifies High Philosophy is the veneration of the High Temples, the High Gods' great legacy. And though there are always arguments over the relative prestige of such temples, no one would deny that the great temples at Tianlou stand above the rest -- in height, and depth, and grandeur.\n\n 'Walking with Harimar', the common name for the pilgrimage to visit these temples, is said to restore one's sense of balance, their focus on High Philosophy's teachings, and help them emulate Harimar himself.\n\nThe Raja, after receiving a returning pilgrim, is reminded of how vital such traits are in the role of the vizier, even if it means time away from court.

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2117.d;The work of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] is usually based in the Lotus Court, after all, any actions here spread outward to influence all Rahen like a drop of ink in water. But sometimes a closer hand is necessary, and [vizier_destination.GetName] seems to cry out for such intervention. A scandal has engulfed the head of the local ministries and all her advisors, and direct action from [4411.GetName] would see [vizier_destination.GetName] through such a storm unscathed, and indeed it might even profit from better leadership.\n\nThe question, of course is whom to send. The vizier, even though they may seek to use the influence in furthering their own interests? Some of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s closest advisors, though their wisdom would be missed at court? Or perhaps [vizier_destination.GetName] can sink, or swim, on their own.;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2120.a;Pathetic.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2120.d;A minor scandal has engulfed our local ministries, crippling their proper function, but it seems the Lotus Court does not care.

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2121.d;When [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] came to [4411.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was surprised that so many seemed to follow a different interpretation of High Philosophy, which seemed so clearly incorrect. It seems some at court have come to such a conclusion themselves, or at least edged towards it, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a few requests over the past few weeks to share more details on the teachings [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] adheres to.\n\nThis is not normal in the course of the viziers' actions, and will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows at court, but there is opportunity as well...;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2122.a;They may do as they please;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2122.b;That is not their role at court!;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2122.d;The vizier is the ultimate insider of the Lotus Court, the soul attuned to all its rumors, with a finger in all its plots. But in one way they are an outsider: they follow a different interpretation of High Philosophy than that of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap].\n\nThat difference has been thrown into stark relief with recent developments: apparently, they've been teaching their interpretation to various courtiers, with some level of popularity! Should the Raja let this stand?;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2122.t;Vizier Spreads Religious School;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2123.a;Fetch my daughter, and fetch the vizier, and fetch a marriage contract!;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2123.b;Nonsense!;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2123.d;There are many rumors that surround the fact our vizier lacks a wife: some speak of past scandal, others of a tragic widowhood, yet others say he is inspired by the eunuchs' administrative capabilities. It would not normally be worthy of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s dignity to spare such a fact even a passing thought, let alone involve [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in such affairs, except... one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] daughters has recently come of age, with no engagement yet planned.\n\nPerhaps we should propose a marriage to the vizier, and bind their loyalty by ties of blood?;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2124.a;I am honoured... what's this about a dowry?;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2124.b;Matchmaker is not a good role for the Raja;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.2124.d;When [Root.Monarch.GetName] was summoned urgently to the Raja, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feared the worst -- an imminent invasion? A plague in the jungles? A discovery in the high temples?\n\nBut as soon as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] arrived at the throne, with a female figure bedecked in jewels and silks at the Raja's side, it was clear something entirely different was afoot.

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.3010.d;One of the most important tasks of the Raja is to keep the many Prabhi and Senapti in line and prevent as much bloodshed as possible while ensuring shared prosperity. One of the ways this is accomplished is through faith. A demand that a ruler take time to complete a meditative ritual while reflecting on their rule and their actions can force any leader to lay down their weapons for a while and stop fighting for land, wealth and glory.\n\nThe Raja has done so now and is demanding that their many subjects carry out a traditional High Philosophy ceremony, and take the time to reflect on their deeds and make amends whenever they feel that they have made transgressions or otherwise failed the teachings of their philosophy.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.3010.t;The Raja Demands Introspection;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.3011.a;We will see where this goes...;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.3011.d;Delivered by a purple-turbaned messenger, accompanied by a small squadron of the Lotus Court's guard, a message from the Raja is not to be ignored. The contents of the letter can be summarized as follows.\n\nAll ministries in the Raj will be subject to increased oversight and control from the Lotus Court, in line with its decrees. And accordingly, all Prabhi and Senapti of the realm will be subject to increased inspections and are expected to fully cooperate with the demands from the Raja and ministries.;;

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.90.b;[R53.Monarch.GetName]'s military expertise is needed if the Raj is to endure this period of crisis.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.90.c;Ganjina is the blood of Amanapurna Peacemaker - perhaps she too can bring peace.;;
Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.90.d;Indranayar of the Lotus Claw ascended to the throne of the Harimraj at the old age of 61. His unlikely ascension was followed by an equally unlikely long reign - though many expected the elderly Indranayar to die the same year he took the Lotus Throne, the grey-whiskered tiger ruled from Dhenijansar for over twenty years. The Raja was a disinterested ruler who allowed the ministries and prahbi to self-govern and delegated most matters to his young Vizier Manava of the Bloody Claw. At a time when the Raj needed a firm hand to steer the ship of state, Indranayar instead utterly failed to deal with the vast issues facing the empire.\n\nBut today, Indranayar’s disastrous and ineffectual reign has finally come to an end, and the matter of his successor is upon the lips of every minister and lord in the city. With no children of his own, Indranayar’s presumed heir was his 4-year old grand-nephew Indrapalar, but many note that putting a child on the throne would be tantamount to crowning the Grand Vizier as Raja.\n\nAs alternative, two other members of the family have been noted. [R53.Monarch.GetName] the Adventurer is the lord of one of Dhenijansar’s outlying districts, and has great experience in military matters. He has proven himself a capable governor and none could challenge his capacity to rule. Conversely, Ganjina the Peaceflower is the only surviving child of former Raja Amanapurna II. Placing a woman on the throne is highly unorthodox, but Ganjina’s blood claim is strong and she is married to the son of Laxanyar, King of Sarnavan - the alliance that would be formed could be vital for preserving the Lotus Claw dynasty in the coming years.\n\nAs the hours draw late, the ministers and viziers debate the question of succession. Only one will sit the Lotus Throne, but who?;;Heдaвнo пpинял дeлeгaцию из Дxeниджaнcapa.

Flavour_Rahen;rahenraj.91.d;The years grind by, and the rusty machinery of the Second Harimraj continues to turn ever more slowly, the signs of administrative corruption clear for all to see. Irrigation canals rot, shipments of grain are sold at massively upmarked prices, and diplomats go unheard at court. Worse still, recent meetings between various important ministers and the staff of the Grand Vizier have been deeply unproductive, and it appears that the efforts of the Vizierate to maintain a working relationship with the corrupt ministries will not be enough to prevent disaster. As the philosophers debate the reasons for the empire’s woes and our enemies circle like vultures beyond the borders, the peasantry suffer from the depredations of corrupt landlords and cry out for someone to save them from their hardship.;;Heдaвнo пpинял дeлeгaцию из Дxeниджaнcapa.

A man as ruthless and pragmatic as he was intelligent, Manava’s efforts to preserve the Raj were viewed by his enemies as a selfish power grab that would see the Bloody Claw dynasty sitting the Lotus Throne. Whether his supporters or detractors were correct in the end will never be known, for the genius arresting the Raj’s downward spiral is no more. The fate of the empire is now left to squabbling ministers and selfish lords, and the Lotus Claw dynasty sits a more precarious perch than ever.;;Heдaвнo былa пpинятa дeлeгaция из Дxeниджaнcapa.

Anyone who is anyone (among those who debate philosophy and history to wee hours of the night) will be there! It is the most fabulous event in all Dhenijanraj (since the last of the Lotus Court's great feasts), a spectacle unlike any other!\n\nIt is the wedding of Kaloyan of Dancer's Alley, better known to us as Kaloyan of the Wandering Heart, to a woman of beauty and grace (not to mention an intellect to rival his own).\n\nHow does a scholar afford such a lavish celebration, you ask? Well, while ""Tooth and Turban: The Rise of the Second Harimraj"" has sold impressively, but in truth the celebrations are well-funded by the crime-lords of his birthplace. It may be city he long since left behind, heading east to follow the course of its founder, Nathalyne, but those lords are not one to forget any debt they owe, and are happy to repay it with such benign expenditures.\n\nWhy does the guest-list include such dignitaries as the sub-director of the Ministry for Taxation, a Mulenese princess, the Exilarch's rowdy chief advisor, and even a Princess from Parusad Bhola? Blame Kaloyan's books. And treatises. And monographs. And all the interviews necessary to compile a dozen tomes on the Harimraj, a local encyclopedia for each of the old Senapti, and some Regent Court philosophy to boot. And of course his magnum opus, ""A Walk in Shadows"" -- a yet-unfinished history of Nathalyne, the first three volumes of which have already sparked untold debate over this woman turned avatar turned deity (and perhaps put more about shadow-magic to paper than had ever existed before).\n\nFor all their pomp, it is not those dignitaries that Kaloyan flocks to. No, it is his fellow scholars, historians, and philosophers. Though Kaloyan may be one of the most successful among them, his esteem is only higher among those who know him best. He is always happy to answer questions, kind in sharing pertinent findings, eager to see the frontiers of knowledge pushed back by them all. \n\nKaloyan has been on adventures aplenty, learned well the value of loyalty and perseverance. Now begins his greatest adventure yet, and as the couple exchanges their vows, it is clear: there is nothing quite like love.";;

Flavour_OrlazamazDihr_I04;ramsteel.1.d;Recently, an age old question has been brought to our attention. After a battle, there are always rams too injured to be of much use anymore. War rams also age out of usefulness and are often too aggressive or hard to take care of to reintegrate back into normal sheep flocks.\n\nTraditionally, these old or worn down rams are simply slaughtered on the battlefield to make mutton. Our rangers form close bonds with their war rams, however, and oftentimes object to the slaughtering of their lifelong companion, even if it is the most practical option.\n\nWith the construction of a vertical farm in our hold, we now have the ability to house animals  more naturally inside the sometimes claustrophobic space that is our mountain works. We can use this space to rehabilitate injured rams as well as keep old and distinguished war rams closer to their former masters to visit, which will surely improve the morale of our citizens. Alternatively, we can override the concerns of our rangers and standardize the selling of butchered old rams to the meat industry.;;Недавно наше внимание привлек извечный вопрос. После битвы всегда есть бараны, слишком раненные, чтобы от них было больше пользы. Боевые бараны также перестают быть полезными и часто слишком агрессивны или о них трудно заботиться, чтобы вернуться обратно в стадо овец.\n\nТрадиционно этих старых или измотанных баранов просто убивают на поле боя, чтобы приготовить баранину. Однако наши рейнджеры тесно связаны со своими боевыми баранами и часто возражают против убийства их спутника жизни, даже если это наиболее практичный вариант. \n\nБлагодаря строительству вертикальной фермы в нашем владении, теперь у нас есть возможность более естественно размещать животных в иногда вызывающем клаустрофобию пространстве, которым являются наши горные работы. Мы можем использовать это пространство для восстановления раненых баранов, а также для того, чтобы старые и заслуженные боевые бараны были ближе к своим бывшим хозяевам, что, несомненно, улучшит моральный дух наших граждан. В качестве альтернативы мы можем преодолеть опасения наших рейнджеров и стандартизировать продажу мяса освежеванных старых баранов.

Scattered around are wayward sheets of metal, half constructed legs, and scorch marks from alchemical misfire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] well remembered the accidents and broken bones that were reported from miscalibrated parts and insufficient craftworks that led up to this final prototype, not to mention the vehement disagreements between advisors as to the feasibility of the project itself.\n\nBut it is finished. The world's first wholly mechanical mount, and the vehicle that will catapult Orlazammer rangers to the most fearsome dwarven cavalry around, is finished. The final product stands proud in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in all its metallic glory, as of yet unblemished and unscratched by the rigours of war that it would later endure.;;[Root.Monarch.GetName] прогуливался по загроможденным полигонам, которые так долго были домом для проекта робо-баранов.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] хорошо помнил несчастные случаи и переломы костей, о которых сообщалось из-за неправильно откалиброванных деталей и недостаточного количества деталей, которые привели к созданию этого окончательного прототипа, не говоря уже о серьезных разногласиях между консультантами относительно осуществимости самого проекта. \n\nНо с этим покончено. Первый в мире полностью механический скакун и средство передвижения, которое превратит орлазамских рейнджеров в самую грозную кавалерию дварфов в округе, готов. Конечный продукт гордо стоит перед [Root.Monarch.GetName] во всей своей металлической красе, пока еще незапятнанный и не испорченный тяготами войны, которые ему предстояло пережить позже.

Apparently, a method has been found to drain the Common Terrace through Hornriver into Lake Logr, which would open the Eastern Vale up for development and use again. The rest of the Vale remains unfixable until some indeterminate time, but even this one area would be a major boon for our interests. It's repair would allow us to start building up the dwarven breadbasket once again and even let some of our flocks return to their homelands.;;С запавшими от недосыпа, но лихорадочно блестящими глазами, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] входит в зал совета.

По-видимому, был найден способ осушения Общей террасы через реку Хорн в озеро Логр, что открыло бы Восточную долину для развития и повторного использования. Остальная часть Долины остается непригодной для ремонта до некоторого неопределенного времени, но даже эта область была бы большим благом для наших интересов. Его ремонт позволил бы нам снова начать строить гномью житницу и даже позволить некоторым из наших стад вернуться на родину.

With a sign, [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks back at the scouting report that was made.\n\n[Root.RamsteelExpeditionObstacle]\n\nA decision had to be made. Which group should take control over the expedition?;[Root.Monarch.GetName] смотрит вниз на собранную экспедицию, идеально разделенную надвое между собранным контингентом рейнджеров и шахтеров. Идея заключалась в том, что рейнджеры были более талантливы в выслеживании и имели некоторый боевой опыт, в то время как шахтерам было удобнее работать в темноте пещер. [Root.Monarch.GetName] надеялся, что две группы смогут работать вместе без конфликтов, но, очевидно, это было не так. Шахтеры с недоверием относились ко всем, кто охотно предпочел бы открытый воздух уютным объятиям гор, и наоборот. [Root.Monarch.GetName] со зачением оглядывает на отчет о разведке, который был сделан.\n\n[Root.RamsteelExpeditionObstacle]\n\nНеобходимо было принять решение. Какая группа должна взять на себя управление экспедицией?

По какой-то причине к нему, похоже, пристроена конюшня, но слишком маленькая, чтобы в ней могли разместиться лошади. А из комплекса вырывается тонкая струйка дыма.\n\nВторая на первый взгляд кажется библиотекой, хотя дни ее славы давно прошли. Его главные колонны потрескались, а вход завалили обломки.

Flavour_OrlazamazDihr_I04;ramsteel.19.d;The buildings in the complex appeared abandoned for the most part, though there were traces of recent use. The rangers trekked carefully toward the origin of the wisp of smoke, wary of goblin remnants. They needn’t have worried however, for it turned out that the smoke was from an old family of dwarves that had been squatting in the ruins for centuries! It turns out they were the remnants of a clan who refused to abandon their forges when the Dwarovar was lost. They have been eking out a living, fighting with monsters all the while, and now pledge their support to Orlazam-az-Dihr’s reclamation of the Serpentspine.\n\nApparently, the stables used to house dozens of rams, which assisted in the production of ramsteel in the traditional way. Luckily for us, there are still tons of equipment and artifacts that would fetch a good price on the open market, as well as make it easy to restart production with the passed down expertise of this isolated family.;;Здания в комплексе по большей части казались заброшенными, хотя там были следы недавнего использования. Рейнджеры осторожно направились к источнику струйки дыма, опасаясь остатков гоблинов. Однако они зря беспокоились, потому что оказалось, что дым исходил от старой семьи дварфов, которая веками проживала в руинах! Оказывается, они были остатками клана, которые отказались покинуть свои кузницы, когда Дваровар был потерян. Они влачили жалкое существование, все это время сражаясь с монстрами, и теперь обещают свою поддержку восстановлению Орлазам-аз-Дира на Змеином Хребте (Sеrреntsрinе). \n\nПо-видимому, в конюшнях раньше содержались десятки баранов, которые помогали в производстве рамстила традиционным способом. К счастью для нас, все еще есть тонны оборудования и артефактов, которые могли бы получить хорошую цену на рынке, а также облегчить возобновление производства с помощью переданного опыта этого изолированного семейства.

Flavour_OrlazamazDihr_I04;ramsteel.2.d;The Gelkalis mountain rams, ridden by the Gelkalis peoples for generations, seems an interesting breed. They have had to survive the mountainous and dry lands south of the Serpentreach perched on the smallest precipices, all while the talons of harpies strike from above. We have heard several tales about their hardiness and impressive size, as is necessary to carry humans upon their backs.\n\nThey seem a perfect fit for our rangers, if the rumours are true. The Gelkalis breed would be able to carry much more weight and supplies, not to mention the fact that their surefootedness and even temperament would make them invaluable traversing the unpredictable Serpentspine. We should obtain a herd, shephard them back to our homelands, and test the mettle of this beast against our own Vale rams.;;Горные бараны Гелкалиса, на которых из поколения в поколение ездят народы Гелкалиса, кажутся интересной породой. Им пришлось выживать в горных и сухих землях к югу от Пределов Змеиной Досягаемости, расположенных на самых маленьких обрывах, и все это время когти гарпий нападают сверху. Мы слышали несколько историй об их выносливости и внушительных размерах, необходимых для того, чтобы нести людей на спине. Они кажутся идеально подходящими для наших рейнджеров, если слухи верны. Порода гелкалис смогла бы нести гораздо больший вес и припасы, не говоря уже о том, что их уверенные ноги и даже темперамент сделали бы их бесценными, преодолевая непредсказуемый Змеиный Хребет (Sеrреntsрinе).

However, their adaptations to rugged terrain makes them slower and less comfortable on the open field, and they are both slower and worse at charging than our existing ram corps.\n\nWe have a difficult decision to make.

Однако их адаптация к пересеченной местности делает их более медленными и менее удобными в открытом поле, и они одновременно медленнее и хуже идут в наступление, чем наш существующий бараний корпус. \n\nНам предстоит принять трудное решение.

Let us adopt the use of mortars and other smaller arms that can fit on a ram to add some extra firepower to our soldiers, while retaining the use of horses and rails to transport around larger artillery pieces.;Доктрина пороха-это будущее, и эффективное сочетание подавляющей огневой мощи и позиционной гибкости будет ключевым фактором в будущих войнах. Однако у нас есть одна проблема. Артиллерия тяжелая. Бараны, хотя и сильны, просто не могут конкурировать с лошадьми за чистую мышечную массу, необходимую для передвижения боевой артиллерии по неровной и часто грязной местности за пределами Змеиного Хребта (Sеrреntsрinе). Давайте перейдем к использованию минометов и другого стрелкового оружия, которое может поместиться на барана, чтобы добавить нашим солдатам дополнительную огневую мощь, сохранив при этом использование лошадей и рельсов для транспортировки более крупных артиллерийских орудий.

anb_events_religion;ravelian.106.d;The burgeoning craft of artificery, that is, empowering or creating new tools using magic and technology, has always been a favourite of the Ravelian Society.

anb_events_religion;ravelian.109.t;Ravelian Society Ridicules Ruler;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.11.a;Let the Ravelian Debates begin!;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.11.da;The Regent Court believes that when you die, you get judged by Nerat, and depending on if you've lived according to your patron deity's ideals determines whether you go to Hell, serve penance in Nerat's armies against Hell, or live your life in blissful paradise in your respective deity's divine plane. While the nature of the Infernal Planes and Nerat's Fugue Plane has been confirmed by countless accounts of demons bound in summoning circles and Red Reapers sighted hunting down undead, it is the nature of the Celestial Planes that has eluded most of the modern world... until now.\n\nGreat research and forays into planar binding have allowed the Ravelian Church to contact and communicate with a great number of celestial beings and have discerned that they too are just as lost as we are. Their beliefs and lore are just as diverse and shrouded in mystery as ours, but one thing persists throughout: that the equivalent of their founder or creator is dead, and that their origin myths all contain an ancestral homeland that their race originated from.\n\nThis revelation, combined with new transcripts from the God Fragment and cross-referencing commonalities of myth in our world's cultures and religions have led to the conclusions that: Heaven exists, but its gates are closed and its location forgotten with the near-death of the One God. The Fugue Plane exists, but not in the way we know it. It is not a demiplane associated with the Shadow Plane, but is instead a Fugue Demesne, a political entity that exists within the Shadow Plane itself. There, the dead do get judged but not by Nerat, but by (red-cloaked) celestial angels of death. Not only that, but the powers of both the celestial and infernal ebb and flow due to belief in their creators. Since the belief in a One God has faltered, so has the powers of the celestials, explaining their absence in the Prime Material Plane.\n\nIt is with this that the Ravelian Church now believes more than ever that revealing the truth of a One God to the world is paramount, and that by restoring faith in God will the gates of Heaven open and salvation can be achieved by all - both mortal and celestial.\n\nThe Ravelian Debate in question now lies: on how do we achieve salvation and empower God in the first place?\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nConversion is but the first step. The Regent Court mythos of emulating your patron's ideals is the truth. God is good and wants us to be good. We must perform Good Works for the church, ourselves and each other if we are truly empower God.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIt is true belief and understanding alone that empowers God. Not only knowing, but truly understanding the Truth is what faith is made of, and as such we can only achieve true salvation through ruminating on the truths that have been revealed before us!;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.11.db;With the last Ravelian Debate securing the need to convert as many people to the faith to empower God and ensure salvation for all, the Second Ravelian Debate deals with internal matters of the church and how it should best achieve that:\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nHeresy and willful ignorance is rife across the world, and if they will not embrace the truth through debate and an open mind, then they must be saved through force. The Ravelian Inquistion will allow our faith to spread like wildfire and save the ignorant from themselves. Inquisitors will also ensure that those that do practice magic do so under the Church's approval, for magic is a gift from God and must not be squandered in dark arts and unholy works, lest they wish to join the heretics on the pyre.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIf heathens and heretics refuse to hear our truth, then it the failure of the Church, not the fault of the unconvinced. False conversions will not help unlock Heaven. We must keep public and cordial discourse with them at all times, and open our minds to learn from their versions of the truth - and perhaps one day, we will reach new revelations together!;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.11.dc;"The idea the there is only One God is a strange one. Seldom do the faiths of the world deny the existence of all others gods, and even the Bulwari say that 'all gods are dead except ours', not 'all gods do not exist except ours'. Indeed, the all-encompassing and all-powerful nature of God has meant that we have found many commonalities in other gods to fold them into our idea of worshipping the One God. By looking at deity figures across Halann in a holistic way, the scholars of the church have determined that lesser ""gods"", like Surael, are in fact but facets, or aspects, of the One God. For God is Everything, and as such can wear many faces.\n\nAdditionally, research into the inner workings of divine figures throughout history like the avatar Corin has revealed that she, along with other prominent avatars, was imbued with otherwordly powers, and that if magic is indeed divine in origin, then she is but a powerful mage gifted with the ability to naturally wield magic, rather than control and tame it as wizards do. We have declared her and other extraordinary individuals that have no doubt been gifted divine providence (like Aldresia in her stopping of the White Pestilence) as the first Saints of the Ravelian Church.\n\nWith these revelations, the question has fallen on how to approach this topic in terms of converting the rest of the world.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nMany cultures have heroic figures and scores of deities. We must use Sainthood as an open palm to welcome them to the fold with ease, even if that means relaxing our restrictions on canonizing new saints. Their heroes are our saints, for God truly works in mysterious ways, and if God did not give these figures of legend divine providence then surely they would not be granted success?\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nOpening our faith to accept anyone and everyone as saints, and god forbid, aspects, is a mockery of the Ravelian Society's original ambitions to unravel the truth of this world. We must scrutinize every saint, every aspect, every religion and every culture with a rational eye. We must not fear upsetting and destroying chances of converting the people if it means eroding the very core of what we believe!";;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.11.dd;The Church has always held the belief that magic is divine. It is at the very foundation of Original Sin for the faith, as the precursor elves had been impatient and stole magic from God, instead of waiting for God to bestow magic upon them when the time was right as They did with dragons.\n\nFor a very long time, most scholars have disagreed with this idea that all magic is divine, but with recent advancements in researching the nature of magic and the God Fragment, the church has put forward a 'True Source of Magic Hypothesis'. The hypothesis is based upon the popular secular theory of 'Universal Magic' which claims that the old categorization of magic into areas like divine, arcane, bardic, and runic, is arbitrary, and was simply a way to explain 'how' magic was manipulated, rather than its true nature. The Ravelian hypothesis builds on this and combines it with existing scripture to provide enough evidence to make even the most hardcore secularist consider their beliefs: there is only one type of magic, but that type is divine, and that God is the true source of magic!\n\nWith these revelations, the church's attention has turned to the usage of artificery. For a long time, the church has believed that artificery was the great equalizer in righting the wrongs of the precursor elves, and allowed all, not just the few, to reap the benefits of magic. The two major factions of the church have proposed conflicting stances on the future of artificery in the Ravelian faith.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nThe great advancements in artificery are not only a vessel to right the precursor elves' sins, but are in fact God's Decree that *now* is the time to spread Their divinity to all Their creations. While not all can harness or be gifted with magic, through artificery we could allow the divine gift of magic to be accessible to everyone and anyone, regardless of if they currently follow our beliefs. This should be done no matter the cost, and as soon as possible, to right the wrongs of the past.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nMagic should be shared, yes, but it is because of magic's divine yet mysterious nature that it should be shared with care and vigilance. Artificery itself is not only holy work but work that requires great time, patience and deliberation. The good works artificery can give to the world must be balanced with heavily scrutinized and sanctified methodology, and if that means withholding great advancements from everyday life to ensure it is done correctly, keeping God's gifts to the faithful only, or even witholding darker and forbidden methods and inventions from the masses for their own safety, then so be it.;;

anb_events_religion;ravelian.4.d;The influence of the Ravelian Society has been pervasive in our lands, and these scholars have since grown from a closeted group of intellectuals to religious community leaders that have uplifted, cared for and taught the commonfolk. Their teachings have truly resonated with the [Root.GetAdjective] people and turned into a populist cause, with many professing to reading the pamphlets of the society on a daily basis, and even agreeing with their revelations and teachings of a religion that is grounded in modern expectations of truth and reason.\n\nThe Society, with the backing of the common people, have petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to allow themselves to create an independent Ravelian State to facilitate the creation of Cannor's first and truly organized religion. With populist backing, they have also suggested that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] convert to this already popular belief system they have cultivated, known as 'Ravelianism'.;;

anb_events_religion;ravelian.5.b;Interesting;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.5.d;The Ravelian Society was originally a group of intellectuals looking to reason and empiricism to discover the true nature of the world. With their research into the God Fragment decades ago, the society eventually discovered what they claim as a fundamental truth in the world: that there is only One God, and that the precursor elves stole magic from Them, nearly killing Them in the process. Along with their revelations they have made themselves indispensable to the masses, uplifting them and caring for them when nations across Cannor have failed, and bringing hope to a populace that an omnipotent and caring God does exist, and They are good: which is a far cry from the dynastic squabbles and flawed personalities and beliefs of the Regent Court and Corinite faith.\n\nAdherents of this new faith call for their cousins to follow this new religion, and follow the whims of God, not the whims of kings. The Ravelian Society is no more, and in its place is the Ravelian Church.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.5.t;Ravelianism Religion Founded!;;

anb_events_religion;ravelian.500.d;We have received reports that the province of [Root.GetName] has been forcibly converted to the Ravelian faith by an angry mob and an even angrier rector.

anb_events_religion;ravelian.502.d;It has come to our attention of a recent trend amongst our colleges and universities, where prominent members of RavelSoc (the local Ravelian University Society) have started inviting other students to debate the nature of religion and the existence of a One True God. Several members of the faculty have become worried, especially due to the fact that many students have debated and converted shortly thereafter.;;

anb_events_religion;ravelian.503.d;Mages have always been a fickle lot, especially when it comes to religion, as they are often wont to believe that their arcane powers is a fine substitute for faith.\nOne such critic has been converted and has finally embraced the Truth, thanks to the persistent influence of our Ravelian courtiers.

anb_events_religion;ravelian.504.b;Makes sense to me.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.504.d;The faithful have gathered in angry crowds and stormed prominent religious minority districts in [Root.GetName], killing many of its inhabitants and vandalizing many of its properties.\n\nThe crowd chants that due to a theory that 'Heaven will only be unlocked once all are converted to the faith', that killing the unfaithful means that more people are true believers overall - so surely that means that the faith is closer to achieving salvation?;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.504.t;Ravelian Pogrom;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.6.a;Sure, maybe they will have better luck!;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.6.b;The artifact should stay in Aelantir;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.6.da;When Aelantir was newly discovered one of our expeditions discovered an artifact called the God Fragment: a strange shard-like object that emitted high-pitched sounds that we soon deciphered to be some sort of ancient language. The precursor expert of our expedition, the elven archaeologist and mage Torrieth, found herself to have an affinity with this object and has since spent her time researching and transcribing whatever knowledge she could gleam from it. So far we have learned little, other than the claim that this shard is the original source of magic, and that it is the surviving essence of a precursor god, or according to Torrieth, the only god to have ever existed!\n\nWith the rise of the Ravelian Society and their specialization in matters of this sort, Torrieth has suggested that she take the God Fragment to Cannor in hopes that she, along with the brightest minds of the Ravelian Society, could decipher more from the God Fragment, and with our permission she would share their findings to us at a later date.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.6.db;In this case you somehow took the province from the person that first got the god fragment from the search chain.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.6.t;Ravelian Society-God Fragment Research?;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.600.a;We support the official stance.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.600.b;Perhaps there is more to this?;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.600.d;The Ravelian faith believes that most, if not all religions are simply aspects of a one true faith and a One True God. Sainthood was a way to recognize holy figures in the mythos of possible-converts, and to some, a clever way to extend an open hand of friendship to those that might be put off by the idea of a monotheistic religion that denies the existence of other faiths.\n\nA recent debate, however, has sparked between our own believers: is it right that avatars, divine reincarnation of the Regent Court gods, are held at the same rank and respect as what were fully-realised deities? An example of this was St. Auci Dameris, Queen of Dameria and St. Minara: Auci has been well-regarded as an avatar of The Dame (an accepted aspect of God) and canonized for her endeavours in bringing the elves to Cannor. Minara, however, has always been regarded as a lesser deity of the Regent Court.\n\nThe church's official stance is that all saints are the same, but the rectors have been arguing and debating this for months now!;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.600.t;Should Avatar-Saints and God-Saints be Equal?;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.601.a;Oh, of course.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.601.b;We will wait for further revelations.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.601.d;"A highly suspect but incredibly influential rector has mentioned to us the other day that they might have found ""proof"" that one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ancestors may have done enough holy works to be canonized as a saint.\n\n""Of course, this research is incredibly expensive.

anb_events_religion;ravelian.602.d;A recently deceased but prominent critic of the [Root.GetAdjective] government has apparently been canonized by the High Rector!\n\nIn life they were an incredibly vocal voice against our endeavours, and now they are a saint, it might impact us badly if we let their criticisms fester.;;

anb_events_religion;ravelian.603.a;Try to mediate.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.603.b;Let them fight.;;
anb_events_religion;ravelian.603.d;The topic of debate in the mouths of the Ravelian faithful have been the idea of Aspects and Saints, and which one is more important. Are all other gods Aspects? Or just some of them? Surely evil gods like Bulwar's Malevolent Dark cannot be an aspect of the One True God, who is all-good? Surely Agrados, who raped Halanna, cannot be a part of God?\n\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has been in a deadlock debating on this over and over and over again, and one of our shrewdest courtiers suggest that letting them distract themselves can allow us to increase our control over the estates.;;

All villages along this path were eventually abandoned due to a resurgence in Wendigos and Veykodan raids.\n\nNow that we prepare to restore order and emerge from the Dark Ages, rebuilding the Tromseloc Way will open up a vital connection between Dolindha and Sarda. We will send parties to clear out ruined waystations before our engineers can repair them or build new ones from scratch, paths will need to be beaten again, and communities will need plenty of encouragement to move in; we will no doubt face stiff resistance from Veykodan tribes, or worse still, ambushes by Wendigos hiding among the trees and ruins, which is why our efforts must be carried out with the maximum alert.";;

However, the advancement of this particular kingdom has seen it borrow these aspects from human style kingdoms. What still sets apart a goblinoid kingdom is its level of social advancement, having a far weaker and looser nobility than a human kingdom. This gives them a degree of administrative flexibility, as well as a more powerful merchant class, called cartels in Dwarven parlance.;;

anb_events;silver_families.1.d;The House of Silmuna is one of the greatest of the Silver Families, originating with the marriage of Munas Moonsinger, who led the Remnant Fleet to Cannor and later led the League of Free Realms against the Sorcerer-King, and Auci Damerid, the Queen of Dameria and avatar of the Dame: goddess of the harvest, knowledge and magic. The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar.\n\nThe dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company. The House of Silmuna is known for its magical power, patronage of the arts, and political ambition.;;"Дoм Cильмунa - oднa из вeличaйшиx cepeбpяныx ceмeй, пpoиcxoдящaя oт бpaкa Moнaшa Глaca Луны, кoтopый пpивeл Флoт Ocтaткoв к Kaннopу, a пoзжe вoзглaвил Лигу cвoбoдныx Kopoлeвcтв пpoтив Kopoля-Чapoдeя, и Aуци Дaмepид, кopoлeвы Дaмepии и Aвaтapa Дaмe: бoгини уpoжaя, знaния и мaгии.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria.\n\nLorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars. This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control. The House of Siloriel is known for its political acumen, martial traditions, and courtly etiquette.;;Дoм Cилopиэль - oднa из вeличaйшиx cepeбpяныx ceмeй, пpoиcxoдящaя oт бpaкa Иopиэль Kpacнoй Poзы, глaвнoгo диплoмaтa и, пocлe cмepти Moнaшa Глaca Луны, лидepa Лиги Cвoбoдныx Kopoлeвcтв вo вpeмя вoйны Kopoля-Чapoдeя, и Pубeнa Лopeнтиca, кopoля Лopeнтa.

None were spared or given the slightest hint of mercy. And thus, an entire generation was lost.""\n-A Historic Account of the Great Incursion, by Raanu Modsuu (1511 AA)§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nThe Centaurs of the Forbidden Plains are ancient creatures, originally being §YFey§!, having existed on §YHalann§! before the start of recorded history. In fact, the Centaurs today no longer live in their homeland, the §YDeepwoods§! in §YEscann§!, which used to stretch all the way to the §YGreatwoods§! in §YGawed§!.\n\nIt was §YCastan Beastbane§! who mercilessly slaughtered most of the non-human races in §YCannor§! from §Y596 to 569 B.A.§!. Like the §YSatyrs§! and §YGnolls§!, the Centaurs almost went extinct in the §YSecond Great Cleansing§!. However, survivors managed to escape to the §YForbidden Plains§!, where they remain today. Their homeland is no longer recognisable, the majority of the woods having been burnt down.\n\nOn the plains, Centaurs have tried to establish a new homeland for themselves, pushing the §Yhumans§! who lived on the mainland to the lakes, where their descendants have formed the §YTriunic§! peoples.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe Centaurs are typically a quarrelsome race, only having been united twice by §YGreat Caehns§! during their history on the plains. Both times, the clans have refractured due to their defeat at the hands of the Triunic city-states.\n\nThe most recent and most devastating invasion was the §YGreat Incursion§!, which began in §Y1433 A.A.§! and ended in §Y1440 A.A.§! The Centaurs took advantage of ancient §YFey magic§!, with the use of §YCentaur shamans§! and the most frigid and harsh winter in Triunic history. The shamans locked ice bridges in place, allowing Centaurs to swarm over the sea and attack the humans. However, the clever humans found out about the shamans, and used any means necessary to slay them. In §Y1439 A.A.§!, the last shaman was killed and the invasion slowly dissipated as the ice bridges melted, causing the remaining warriors to be slaughtered.\n\nNow, you lead one of many Centaur clans, dreaming to unify your people once more. However, the humans have signed a treaty of unity, joining together in the ambitious §YLake Federation§!. O Great Caehn, you must crush these foolish dreams below the thunderous tremor of hundreds of thousands of hooves. Will you   unite the clans and conquer once more? Or will your wars cause a Third Great Cleansing? Or perhaps you will succeed... only to fall apart as a war lasts a little too long?\n\nMay your enemies tremble before you and lay dying in regret for their savage actions in annihilating your kind.

anb_forbidden_plains_startup;string_start_ogre_kingdoms_description;"§OPrimer§!\nThe Ogres, along with §YTrolls§!, are the last of the §YGiantkin§! in Halann. The §YTrue Giants§! were one of the original races to inhabit the world, eons ago, but fell in a mutually destructive conflict with the §YDragons§! well before the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!. The Ogres claim that they devoured the True Giants and as such gained their strength and power; these cannibalistic beliefs continue to influence their religion (the §YFeast of the Gods§!) and culture.\n\nOgres have long roamed the Forbidden Plains, though the §YGreat Caehn Neagol§!'s conquest of the central steppes coupled with climactic changes after the Day of Ashen Skies led to the Sandmaw Ogres being driven extinct and the §YFathide Ogres§! pushed to the western hills. In AA 28, with the Fathides seemed poised to meet the Sandmaws' fate, their destiny was forever reshaped by the crash-landing of a §YSky Giant Fortress§! into their hills. The inhabitants had perished, and the Ogres gladly feasted on their corpses, regaining their strength and allowing them to survive the long famine years. The chief of the Gravelhide clan, §YGhornma Gravelhide§!, subjugated all the other clans that flocked to the ruins, and formed the kingdom of Maghargma.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor centuries, the dominant Ogre Kingdom has remained §YMaghargma§! in the south, which makes its capital in the old Sky Giant fortress. In its prime the Kingdom extorted tribute from dozens of other §YGreat Clans§!, along with a plethora of Centaur tribes who brought slaves and food in return for boons of iron and steel. The northern tribes, however, have remained rebellious ever since AA 125, when §YRoghrin Gravelhide§!'s rivals fled there following his victory in the §YMaghargma civil war§!. The states closer to Maghargma's power base remain loyal, though some of the outlying Great Clans merely pay lip service to their sovereign.\n\nIn 1440, however, the same Centaur invasion that forced the §YTriunic Peoples§! in the East to unify into the §YLake Federation§! in defense also struck westward, and slew Maghargma's ruler Borigg Gravelhide in battle. His son §YZiltagh Gravelhide§! seized the throne, but he was not another in the long line of Maghargma's rulers who were content to merely sit on their throne and eat. A massive ogre, who crushed centaurs whole with a single blow during his counteroffensive against the Hordes' incursion, his rise has been a check to any rebellious tendencies amongst other Ogres.\n\nStill, every Ogre knows one truth above all: the world is eat or be eaten. Will Ziltagh be able to re-establish Maghargma's dominance, quite literally devour the Forbidden Plains, and even crown himself §YMengurkha§!, ruler of all Ogres? Or will one of their vassals consume the fading state and take up its mantle? Or shall it be one of the §YWild Clans§! in the North, who look south with a blend of fear and ambition and wait for the chance to take a bite—or several—of their own, that shall claim dominance and form §YSurkokli§!?

That is, that everything must be consumed in a never-ending charge that is akin to a great storm. It is through this, that Centaurs can access the §YEternal Plains§! (Ik Maghtaal).

Originally a group of nomadic tribes, the §YKhamgunai§! people first arrived on the lakes in §Y680 BA§!. A hundred years later, more humans would immigrate to the region due to raging hordes of §YCentaurs§!, who fled to §YForbidden Plains§! after §YCastan II Beastbane§! burned down most of the §YDeepwoods§!.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes consists of plenty of arable land and some of the most fertile soil in the world, allowing it to easily maintain a population of millions of people. However, it wasn't until the §YDay of Ashen Skies§! that most of the remaining humans on the mainland migrated to the lakes and established more sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes are divided into three cultures: the §YKhamgunai§! (the original settlers of the land), the §YMetsamic§! (tending to themselves in fortified cities), and the §YZabatlari§! (who have begun to dominate the economy).\n\nThere are also three religions in the region, each representing a lake which in turn represents a goddess: §YKodave§!, §YYukel§!, and §YEnuuk§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLake Federation§! is in its infancy, only being formed in §Y1441§!. While there were previous precedents of unity such as the §YAmberpact§!, none were as ambitious or as encompassing as the federation, which attempted to finally end the petty internal squabbles of the lakes. However, this was only due to the recent Centaur invasion, which happened to be the largest and most devastating in Triunic history.\n\nNicknamed the §YGreat Incursion§!, the Centaur Shamans made use of the harshest winter ever recorded by locking the frozen lakes in place and using them as ice bridges, allowing huge centaur hordes to invade, wreaking havoc across the south. Thousands upon thousands of people were slaughtered, many having to be buried in unmarked mass graves or simply abandoned in the open. The path of blood finally ended in §Y1440§! with the hunting of the last shamans in §Y1439§!.\n\nYou lead a city-state in the south, still recovering from the invasion. With scores of villages and farmland abandoned, it’s up to you to throw your weight in the federation for aid in the recovery efforts.

anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.1.d;Our adventurers in Aelantir have come across an incredible new discovery — with chilling implications.\n\nUnder an ancient precursor temple lies a vast hall of murals, remarkably intact despite the ruin of the rest of the temple complex. These murals seem to depict the entire history of elven civilization, including events such as the War of Broken Chains, which saw the fall of dragons and the freedom of the enslaved elves, as well as the more recent War of Two. These visual histories flesh out what little knowledge of precursor civilization survived the elves' millennium at sea and will certainly be of vast interest to the Chronicler's Guild — but they are of little immediate concern compared to the events depicted in the final mural of the hall.\n\nClearly carved in a less refined hand than the other murals, the final panel shows a scene of utter destruction and ruin, a great fireball rising from the middle of a continent, raining stone and lightning down onto the land. Off to one side a man is seen descending from the clouds – he wields a scepter in one hand and is extending his other arm in an effort to contain the explosion, lightning streaking towards him as he does so. The extended arm terminates in a stump instead of a hand, and a great silver cloak covers his left side and partially obscures his missing leg. The artist's inscriptions have been partially translated and our scholars believe they label the figure Castellar, God of the Sky — and the explosion is denoted simply as The End.\n\nThis carving is clearly a depiction of the Ruin of Aelantir, perhaps from someone who witnessed it firsthand and survived long enough to draw what they saw, giving their remaining time to passing a record of events on to future generations. If what is carved here is true, then the elven sky god Castellar attempted to stop the catastrophe that caused the Ruin – but based on the state of Aelantir, he failed.\n\nWe are left with more questions than answers. Only a fool could fail to notice the similarity in name, appearance, and domain of Castellar and the Regent Court’s reigning god Castellos. If Castellar and Castellos are one and the same, and Castellar attempted to halt the Ruin of Aelantir but failed... what became of him?  We have no way to know, but the debate around the veracity of the events portrayed in these murals and their implications for our society is already fierce among the scholars studying the temple.

anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.10.a;At this point, it does not seem possible to contain the rumors.;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.10.d;When we took control of [Root.GetName], we discovered records that describe a temple filled with stone murals depicting the entire history of elven civilization. The last of these murals was ominously titled “The End”, and depicts a man descending from the clouds, wielding a scepter in one hand and attempting to contain a vast explosion with the other. The artist's incomplete notes label the figure as Castellar, God of the Sky – and based on this and other notes recovered from the site, the creator of the mural appears to believe that Castellar perished in the blast.\n\nBefore they reached us, the documents had already passed through the hands of dozens of soldiers, scholars, and civilians, and more than a few are beginning to talk about the implications of what these writings mean. It is only a matter of time before the rumors are common knowledge.;;

anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.2.d;While we have tried to keep our discovery of the Mural of Castellar a secret, it appears that someone – perhaps one of the adventurers involved in the initial expedition, perhaps one of our scholars – has leaked and sold a very complete catalogue of the information found at the temple complex to the Order of Chroniclers, likely for a hefty reward. They, in turn, have promptly printed and released our official documents and rubbings of the murals to scholars across Cannor, and despite our best efforts to prevent the information from spreading it is moving like a wildfire through the scholarly halls and elite circles of Halcann. In Lorentain? and Gaweton, Anbennc?st and Celmaldor and even in the ruins of Castonath, the rumors are starting to swirl – the Precursor elves saw Castellos die, and wrote down what they saw so we would know.;;Xoтя мы дepжим в ceкpeтe нaшe oткpытиe o cмepти Kacтeллoca, пoxoжe, чтo oдин из aвaнтюpиcтoв (или, вoзмoжнo, дaжe oдин из нaшиx coбcтвeнныx учeныx) пpoдaл инфopмaцию Opдeну Лeтoпиcцeв, кoтopый быcтpo oбнapoдoвaл дoкумeнты!

anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.3.c;What else does Aelantir have to reveal?;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.3.d;News from Aelantir has arrived, spread widely by the Order of Chroniclers and proclaimed by Tellumite criers in every major town: in a ruined precursor temple, a mural with chilling implications.\n\nA scene of utter destruction and ruin, a great fireball rising from the middle of a continent, raining stone and lightning down onto the land. Off to one side a man is seen descending from the clouds – he wields a scepter in one hand and is extending his other arm in an effort to contain the explosion, lightning streaking towards him as he does so. The extended arm terminates in a stump instead of a hand, and a great silver cloak covers his left side and partially obscures his missing leg. The artist's inscriptions have been partially translated and our scholars believe they label the figure Castellar, God of the Sky — and the explosion is denoted simply as The End.\n\nThe documents of discovery and rubbings of the murals are widespread across Cannor, and are spreading like a wildfire through the scholarly halls and elite circles of Halcann. In Lorentain? and Gaweton, Anbennc?st and Celmaldor and even in the ruins of Castonath, the rumors are starting to swirl – the Precursor Elves saw Castellos die, and wrote down what they saw so we would know.;;Boкpуг Kaннopa и Дивeнxoлa, кaк лecнoй пoжap, paзлeтeлиcь вecти o нeдaвнeм oткpытии в Aэлaнтиpe: Kacтeллoc, пpaвящий Бoг Peгeнтcкoгo Двopa, мepтв.\n\n Haxoдки гoвopят, чтo oн пoжepтвoвaл coбoй дaвным-дaвнo, чтoбы cдepжaть paзpушeниe Aэлaнтиpa, кoтopoe вызвaлo Дeнь Пeпeльнoгo Heбa.

anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.4.a;Perhaps the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] scepter behind...;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.4.b;What an interesting discovery. That is, if we cared about him.;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.4.d;In our continued exploration of the lost elven homeland we have come upon many ruins not only of the precursor elves but of the various ruinborn groups that rebuilt in the wake of the Ruin of Aelantir. One of our most recent expeditions into the interior came upon a small, ruined shrine that appears to have been built by some long-extinct group of ruinborn. Inside the sanctum at the heart of this shrine our explorers discovered an elaborately wrought stone tabernacle with a single object inside of it – a staff, nearly 6 feet in length, carved of a single piece of white stone and capped with a solid blue orb at one end. The other end terminates in what appears to have once been a large, faceted gem, but no longer — only tiny crystalline shards remain.\n\nOur scholars have spent some time discussing what the origin and nature of this staff might be. Preliminary analysis of the magical aura lingering upon the staff indicates that it was once used in powerful abjuration magics, but not much else could be gleaned. During one of these discussions the resident priest on the expedition remarked that the staff resembled an oversized version of Castellos’ sceptre – the white shaft and blue sphere similar in appearance to his holy symbol, though the flanged head of the Rod of Rulership is absent on the artifact found in the shrine.\n\nIf not for the Mural of Castellar, this would be just one more oddity in the long list of oddities that have met us since we began exploring Aelantir. But if the mural is accurate and Castellos fell containing the destruction of the Day of Ashen Skies... could this not be his real scepter? The magics that still linger on it are protective in nature, and the resemblance is more than passing... but it lies broken beyond any hope of repair. What could that imply about Castellos himself?;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.4.t;The Broken Scepter;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.5.a;It’s hard to feel that the whole world isn’t unraveling around us...;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.5.b;This is proof of the Sun Cult's teachings.;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.5.d;Pamphlets spread around Cannor and the Divenhal like wildfire, the claims printed there more inflammatory than the hottest embers: Castellos, the ruling god of the Regent Court, is dead.\n\nPublished by the Order of Chroniclers, the printings detail murals located in an ancient precursor ruin containing vast carvings depicting the whole course of precursor civilization. The last of these murals appears to have been made after the Ruin of Aelantir and depicts a deity named Castellar – known to Cannorians as Castellos – trying and failing to prevent the calamity. Copies of the mural are printed on the back of every pamphlet so that all can see the sky god’s end, and the Tellumite Town Criers shout the words from the rooftops: Castellos is Dead.\n\nIn addition to the rapidly spreading pamphlets, a radical group of apprentice mages within the Magisterium became convinced of the Chroniclers' claims and hatched a plot to seize the Tower of Adr?il and use its magic amplifying properties and location in the middle of the Dameshead to project the image of the mural on the clouds for all to see. Just a few days ago, the image of Castellar faltering before the devastation of the Ruin of Aelantir appeared in the evening sky, the flickering of the mural’s form against the clouds almost giving the illusion of the lightning shearing away Castellar’s outstretched hand. The plotters were quickly apprehended and expelled by the Magisterium, but there is no undoing what they did, no way for the population of the Imperial states to unsee the image cast upon the clouds.\n\nThe shock and anger at the Chroniclers’ revelation has reverberated throughout Halcann, with many claiming the Chroniclers are lying and demanding action against them, while others defend the Chroniclers’ impeccable record as being beyond reproach. Still others clamor for answers from the religious leaders, most of whom are just as shocked as their congregations. The various clerics of the pantheon offer different answers as they write a flurry of letters back and forth and the high priests attempt to calm the situation. All the while, the question of the accuracy of the Chroniclers’ report hangs in the clergy’s heads – for if they are correct, then for all these years the Regent Court has been led by a dead god.;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.5.t;CASTELLOS IS DEAD;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.6.a;[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and all [Root.GetName], will observe the rites of mourning.;;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.6.b;"He has been dead for millennia, in truth; it is time to look forwards and not back!";;
anb_age_of_unraveling;unraveling.6.d;"Followers of Balgar tend toward magnificent tombs, adherents of Munas are given to the waves, those of The Dame are buried by the light of the moon. But what kind of funeral do you give a God?\n\nThat is one of many questions the Eleventh Pantheonic Council of the Regent Court has set out to answer. Every high priest of every temple has taken in the mural of Castellar, in magical rendition or having gone to Aelantir to see it in person. They have seen, one or two even touched, his shattered scepter. And they have born witness as most Cannor has come to believe in his death — with not even a whisper from the Gods to contest it.\n\nThe gathered representatives of each God had expected discord over the claim of Castellos's death, unprecedented in the history of the Court, but there was little. Even Castellos's own representative, an aged Castellyrian refugee, was more relieved to finally have an answer to the question that has twisted his soul for decades: why the Silver Dragon did not come again.\n\nInstead, most of the debate has been around what happens next. Traditional Cannorian succession law would have his son, Adean, take the throne. But that was rooted in the traditions of Castellos' favoured country, Castanor. With him gone, with that old Empire gone, does it really still apply in the court of the Gods?\n\nAdherents of Corin, led by Dominic of Gallowspeak — now wizened with more than nine decades of age, but still a member of her circle, a recorder of her teachings, a speaker of her truths — argue otherwise. Instead, they claim succession would obviously be a contest based on merit — one at which surely the Heroine of the Greentide excels. Moreover, she inherited the legacy of Agrados, Castellos's brother, and thus has a dynastic claim as well. The priests of Adean's mother (Esmaryal) and sister (Ryala) are quick to back the God of Chivalry and Righteousness; many others, especially the priests of Nathalyne and Falah, are not so sure.\n\nThis debate has raged for weeks, and may rage for weeks more. But on one thing, at least, there is agreement: Castellos is indeed dead. All Cannor, all Halann, shall mourn him. And the world will never be the same.";;

ynn_loc;ynn_events.205.d;Today a remarkable visitor clad in robes and wielding an antler wand came before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], offering their service.\n\nWhile many wielders of magic exist throughout the Ynn, such as the harvest mages of Stantirshalas and the water-casting Riverblades of Vels Bacar, the magical studies they conduct are more often than not secondary to their main skillset and so it is hard to ascertain their true power and knowledge. The mage standing before [Root.Monarch.GetName] today, however, has proof of studying at the Academy of Rzenta, a magical institution established in imperial times at the border of the fey-infested forests northwest of Dolindha.\n\nA mage endorsed by the academy is no party performer, having passed rigorous study under talented teachers to be approved by the faculty. This mage would be of great aid to either administration or war efforts.;;

The town of [1140.GetName] has a history as the gossip capital of the Ynn, and not even the Divine River is powerful enough to stop baseless rumours from crossing north to south, east to west, though one may at least hope that when reckoning comes, all who took part in such falsities without caution nor remorse will be swallowed by its cleansing tides.;;

ynn_loc;ynn_events.207.desc;A susurrus of rumours has been brewing throughout [Root.GetName]. Soon the hushed rumours grew into tales: slain beasts and bandits, brash duels and kind deeds, uncovered treasures and aided farmers, all centering around one individual, who has finally made his formal appearance.\n\nHailing from the deep forests of [2813.GetName], this young individual is barely a man by age. Yet he has proven to be a man by deeds, resoundingly succeeding at the tradition known to his home villagers as “Potraga”, where any male aged 16 sets out on a lone journey to see the world and its people. And during this one's journey, he came to the realm of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and achieved numerous feats, enough to make him known as a hero and win him an audience at the court in [Root.Capital.GetName], where the public, and surely the hero himself as well, expect to see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] praise and reward him for his bravery and talent.;;

ynn_loc;ynn_events.22.d;"Having for long stood on what we considered the edge of the world, the visitors who arrive to [1133.GetName] from below are usually limited to the occasional group of Boek climbers or Cheshoshi mercenaries, but today that changed: elves with pinkish skin and rounded ears - not unlike those of a knight - came visiting the holy city, bringing with them not just weapons and pouches, but also carriages pulled by small, antlerless horses.\n\nUpon questioning, we were surprised to learn that the majority of them were not elves at all, but a variety of species: what they had in common was that they all hailed from a farawy continent known as ""Krarh Nor"", the New Land.\n\nTheir carriages were filled with exotic crops, quality furniture, new and unconventional weapons, garments worthy of our ladies, even a tasty tree-shaped food item called mushroom. In exchange for their gifts, they simply asked to be let into the city, where they could witness the great dam of [1133.GetName], the sight of which had drawn them from afar.";;

The fighting continued on the inside, as we fought room-by-room, until every Rzentur in the building lay dead.\n\nOnce the dust settled, our mages determined that the Dragon Prince was dead, and presented us with the body of a teenaged boy in noble clothes, none other than the creature itself having taken Rzentur form.;;

ynn_loc;ynn_events.300.d;"The Water Serpents that swim beneath the Ynn are astonishing creatures, the greatest of which are said to be longer than the very tributaries of the Ynn River and older than the Ending Flood.\n\nSuch aura of profundity doesn't stop the youth in all its hubristic vigour from trying to jest with them: a group of farm boys, 26 in number, is carrying a 7 meters long water serpent through the countryside while singing at full lungs about their strength. The creature, who had the misfortune of washing ashore, still wiggles within the boys' grip as they approach [Root.Capital.GetName]'s gates; there they half-seriously explain to the guards that this creature was given to them by the Holy River, and that they want to parade it in front of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the Water Serpent Stuir Balia celebrations, so that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may name it King of the Stuir Balia and grant it a royal pool worthy of its status.\n\nCatching wind of this almost instinctively, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] saddles [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] horse and rides to the gates.

ynn_loc;ynn_events.301.d1;As our departed ruler makes the final journey down the sacred River, a great Water Serpent rises from below to accompany the barge. Scales shimmering bright green, blue, and gold, with parts of its body covered in river-barnacles and freshwater weeds, it glares with ancient eyes at passing boats and wildlife, a warning to stay away.\n\nIts body longer than the most opulent of barges, some witnesses claimed they could see its tail stretching far out in the horizon past the bends of the great River. After escorting the barge for some days the serpent blows a last blast of shining water into the air over the barge, like a priest administering a blessing, before diving back down into the depths.;;
ynn_loc;ynn_events.301.d2;As the departed ruler's barge makes its way down the Ynn, a great water serpent emerges roaring from the deep.

After a local baron witnessed the animal in action and commented that such a talented pet would serve as a gift for even a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the fisherman decided to travel to [Root.Capital.GetName] to present his liege with the otter as a gift.;;

ynn_loc;ynn_events.305.d;While the presence of wild animals near settlements can be often interpreted as a good omen by Ynnic elves, the people within the province of [ynn_giant_beaver_attack.GetName] had to think again. A family of beavers - giant beavers to be precise - established themselves a short walk upstream of a village, living in peace with the local inhabitants for a time… until the giant beavers built a dam which rerouted a stream, causing it to wash into the nearby village.\n\nIn the ensuing flooding the once happy village was turned into an array of ponds while honest people, by a cruel twist of fate, were left homeless because of the very water that feeds into their divine River Ynn.;;

The collapse of the Ynnic Empire had resulted in a general distrust towards centralized army systems, and as such the various Iosahar (Oathkeepers) enjoyed greater freedoms: they paid no taxes and were free to raise large armies that could challenge their overlords and wage their own wars.\n\nAs local protection was the main purpose of this system, overlords needed to rely on trust in order to gear their vassal network towards offensive wars and centralization.;;

The Iosahar system ensured that each town and village would have valiant knights ready to defend it at the expense of the central Overlord's power.\n\nAs Overlord, the first step in centralizing our rule will be to call forth all the main vassals in our realm for a council.
