They however lost most of their divine power in the process, and are as such bound to take a passive role now, instead of the Daedra who can be much more active. As part of the divine contract of creation, the Aedra are also thought to be killable. The Trickster God Lorkhan, and the Two Moons are thought to have been killed, with their dead body still obversable to this day.\n\nThe Aedra are worshipped through most of Tamriel, but their most known followers would probably be the worshippers of the [enc_divines|E]."

This makes alchemy a potentially very lucrative and very dangerous trade, as the most expensive ingredients produce the most powerful poisons and potions, but are also hidden in the most deadly places."

As [enc_lorkhan|E] convinced the other Aedra to create the Mortal Plane, Magnus was known as the 'Architect of Mundus', due to the diagrams and schematics he drew for the other deities to follow.\n\nAfter learning of Lorkhan's treachery Magnus was among the first, and the most powerful, to decide to leave the newly created mortal plane, tearing a hole through the fabric the edge of Mundus, allowing raw energy from Aetherius to pour unto the plane. Those who decided to follow him, the Magna-Ge, teared their own holes as they followed Magnus, which became known as the stars.\n\nHe is still revered in the Altmeri and Breton pantheons, and followers of Magnus can be found throughout Tamriel."

So named because he features prominently in most cosmogonies as a casualty of creation, killed by the other gods in their anger at his trickery.\n\nHe convinced his fellow gods to join him in his project to construct a new plane. Halfway through, the Architect Magnus learned the truth of the Missing God's designs and departed, leading an exodus of gods remembered as the Magna-Ge.\n\nThe remaining gods who chose to complete the project and lost most of their powers in the process became the Aedra, the Earthbones and Ehlnofey, the latter of which would eventually become the mortal races.\n\nWhether you revere or abhor him, most agree the Missing God played a pivotal role in enabling the existence of the mortal plane, and as such life as we know it. Opinions diverge whereas the existence of mortal life is a blessing — a position held by most beliefs sympathetic or neutral towards him — or a curse — the stance of most faiths that actively see Mundus as a barrier to immortality and a fall from grace."

It is known for a fact, however, that it was already in full swing by the late Merethic Era. The Schism began the twilight of the Imperatum Saliache and the Ayleid civilization as a whole. Some would call it a civil war and they would technically be correct. Multiple centuries of proxy feiting and bloody struggle between Aedra-worshipping Barsaebic and Daedra-worshipping Atataric factions served to unseam and polarize the Ayleid society, and empty Ald-Cyrod of much innocent blood.To the contemporaries, the Narfinsel hostilities seemed to never end, but like all things, they too came to pass. In 1E 198, the Aran of Atatar crushed the Aedraphiles in the infamous Scouring of Wendelbek, rendering the movement weak and disorganized. The Barsaebic vestiges fled Southeast, towards the Argonian borderlands of Shadowfen, Blackwood, and Keener Coast. This marked the triumph of the Atatarics and the unconditional primacy of Daedra worship in Cyrodiil until the Alessian Rebellion in 1E 242, not even half a century after the climax of the Schism."
