 alinor_isolationism.0002.desc.open: "To the surprise of the local population, the kingdom of Alinor has opened itself to outside interaction. More foreign traders are arriving to Summerset's shores, and more High Elven ships are leaving for Tamriel. But it seems that many Altmer did not appreciate such a change to their way of life, and the rulers of Alinor are now dealing with a discontent population."

 alinor_isolationism.0002.a: "And so the wheel keeps turning."
