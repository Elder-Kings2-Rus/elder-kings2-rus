After being driven from Skyrim by Ysgramor and his heirs, the Snow Elves made their last stand on Solstheim. The Nords, wielding superior weaponry, dominated the battlefield, but the tide briefly turned with the arrival of the Snow Prince, a skilled warrior on a pale steed who cut through the Nordic ranks, killing many. However, his death at the hands of Finna, a grieving Nordic girl who avenged her mother by throwing a sword into his chest, shattered the morale of the Snow Elves. With their leader fallen, the Elves fled or were slaughtered.\n\nThis defeat sealed the fate of the Snow Elves, and the Nords cemented their dominance over Solstheim and Skyrim.#!"

It resulted from escalating tensions after the Direnni outlawed the Alessian Doctrines and clashed with Imperial-held lands. Despite previous defeats, the Alessians advanced westward, leading to a final confrontation.\n\nThe Direnni were aided by the Ayleids of Nenalata and the High King of Skyrim, both fearing Alessian expansion. Thanks to this unlikely alliance, the Direnni emerged victorious, but the battle was costly for both sides. The Alessians were expelled from High Rock, a blow that contributed to their eventual decline, while the Direnni lost their hegemony, and High Rock fell to the Bretons.#!"

Hira sought to consolidate his rule by eradicating the Sword-singers, whose mastery of the Shehai made them a significant threat. Among those targeted was Divad Hunding, a famed musician who became a resistance leader after escaping captivity, and his father, Frandar Hunding, a reclusive Sword-singer and strategist. Frandar was eventually convinced to lead the remaining Singers. Together, they formed the "Army of the Circle" and trained in Frandar’s strategies, which included six preliminary battles designed to hone their skills and lure Hira’s army deeper into the wilderness.\n\nThe final battle at Mount Hattu pitted the vastly outnumbered Singers against Hira’s 300,000-strong army. Despite their smaller numbers, the Singers achieved a hard-fought victory, destroying Hira’s forces but suffering significant losses themselves. Unable to remain in Yokuda, Frandar and the surviving Sword-singers departed from the port city of Arch and set sail for Tamriel.#!"

King Joile of Daggerfall led the coalition with support from the Order of Diagna, Sentinel, and the Bjoulsae River Tribes.\nThe siege was marked by intense resistance from the Orcs and internal conflicts among the attackers. King Joile betrayed his allies by plotting against the Redguards and orchestrating the deaths of key leaders, including Gaiden Shinji of the Order of Diagna, as part of his preparations for a future invasion of Hammerfell. Efforts by Orcish diplomats to sow discord among the attackers further prolonged the siege.\nDespite these delays, the campaign ultimately culminated in the breaching and complete destruction of Orsinium.#!"

Their relentless advance was halted when Empress Hestra of the Alessian Empire led her legions into western Hammerfell to confront them.\nAfter a bloody retreat, the Gray Host reached the Bangkorai Garrison, where they launched a brutal assault, overwhelming the gates and slaughtering soldiers. Amid the chaos, a humble beadle named St. Pelin made a sacrificial stand. He offered his own blood to the vampires, praying to Stendarr for strength.

This allowed the defenders to push back, with reinforcements arriving to finish the fight.\nThe combined efforts of the Garrison and Empress Hestra’s forces led to the Gray Host's annihilation.

Prince Juilek's Imperial Army, aided by Potentate Versidue-Shaie, used a cunning strategy to outmaneuver Vivec's forces. While Vivec anticipated an attack across the straits of Lake Coronati, the Imperials employed alteration magic to breathe underwater, enabling their heavily armored soldiers to cross the lake undetected. This surprise maneuver allowed the Imperials to assault Ald Marak from its least fortified, waterbound western side, securing the well-defended fortress before Vivec could respond.\nDespite Vivec's attempts to rally his forces, Ald Marak's fall was a decisive blow.#!"
