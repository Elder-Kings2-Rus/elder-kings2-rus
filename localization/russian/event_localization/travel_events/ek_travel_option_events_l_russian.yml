 ek_travel_option_events.0001.intro: "While passing through [location.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier], I come across a [local_character.GetWomanMan] on the road. It doesn’t take long to recognize the signs - cautious glances over the shoulder, fingers instinctively brushing a hidden dagger, and a weight in the eyes that only those on the fringes of society carry. No doubt, this person had a compelling reason to leave [local_character.GetHerHis] people behind. Perhaps [local_character.GetSheHe] could prove a valuable addition to my camp. As I draw closer, I’m met with a [ROOT.Char.Custom2('QuirkAdjectivePosOrNeg', SCOPE.sC('local_character'))] smirk on [local_character.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"

 ek_travel_option_events.0001.good: ""I think I may be valuable to your cause." [local_character.GetSheHe|U] says. "Question is, how much is my service worth to you?""

 ek_travel_option_events.0001.a: "Take these coins and prove your worth!"
 ek_travel_option_events.0001.provisions: "I trust a meal will suffice as payment, won't it?"
 ek_travel_option_events.0001.b: "I have no need for such a useless [local_character.Custom('InsultNoun')]."
