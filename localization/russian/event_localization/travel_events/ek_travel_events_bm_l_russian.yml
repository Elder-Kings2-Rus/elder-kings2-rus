 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.desc: "The endless wetlands of the Black Marsh abruptly come to an end. My entourage brushes past the foliage and enters a welcome clearing, its ground a reddish clay — and thankfully firmer and drier than any we've walked the last few days.\n\nBut suddenly the ground moves beneath us. The clay bubbles like tar. It's becoming mud, and we're scrambling to escape — but the slush is already reaching our knees."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.guide: "\n\n"Wait", says my guide [argonian_guide.GetFirstName], [argonian_guide.GetHerHis] tone flat and even. "We're being picked up by a friend.""
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.native: "\n\nYou know exactly what this is. You're about to be swallowed by a rootworm, the swamp's fastest - and least predictable - way to travel."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.desc2: "\n\nThe ground opens; it is a great maw beneath us, and we are swallowed whole!"
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.a: "I'll have to trust the guide then..."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.a.tt: "An uncertain fate awaits you..."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.a.flavor: "This option is available because of the Argonian Guide in your [entourage|E]"
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.b.flavor: "This option is available because your [culture|E] has the #V $innovation_black_marsh_natives$#! [innovation|E]"
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.c.flavor: "Whatever this is, you decide to fight it!"
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.b: ""Everyone, stay calm!""
 ek_travel_events_bm.0001.c: ""Everyone, get yourself out!""

 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_freed: "With no time to lose, I shouted commands to my entourage. Working together, we were able to escape the creature's mouth. Stabbing at and clinging to the edges, and working together, we held it open. I ushered the last of the group to safety, gasping in shock on the edge of the new-formed pit that already seemed to be filling in behind us.\n\nCatching a final glimpse of the mysterious beast, we saw translucent skin and a spacious interior. It seemed it would not react at all to the damage — if we'd done any — to its mouth."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_guide: "Even more shocking than being swallowed alive was my guide's reassurances, but there was little choice but to trust [argonian_guide.GetHerHim]. These shocks eventually passed, and we found ourselves inside of the mouth of some gigantic beast. [argonian_guide.GetFirstName] later explained it to me: the beast was a vast "rootworm", an underground creature used for travelling the marsh between such red clearings as the one I had mistaken for a resting site. Apparently, we were taken for a ride."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_native: "Despite the initial shock of being swallowed alive, this was a welcome surprise. We'd found ourselves carried by one of the vast rootworms, who burrow their bulk through the roots of the Black Marsh at blinding speed. The red clay, of course, marks one of the many entries into this underground express; now, we only need to know how and when to get out again. I let myself be taken for the ride."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_failed: "Nothing we did could get us away from the maw in the ground. It closed around us and then, within the creature, it seemed like we were being thrown through a tunnel. I could barely hear my companions around me, and they seemed not to hear me, either. Buffeted from side to side, and vomiting from motion sickness, it seemed that we were soon to die."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.end: "\n\nWe couldn't tell how long we were travelling. Just as suddenly as we were swallowed, we were again spat out. Pushed through the muddy ground, we were on the surface of a clearing just like the one that we'd come from. It was time to move on before it could happen again."
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_lost: "\n\nOnce at a safe distance, we tallied our numbers. We were short one: what happened to [entourage_member.GetFirstName]?"
 ek_travel_events_bm.0002.desc_lost.tt:0 "[entourage_member.GetFirstName] was swallowed, and spat out a random location within Black Marsh!"
