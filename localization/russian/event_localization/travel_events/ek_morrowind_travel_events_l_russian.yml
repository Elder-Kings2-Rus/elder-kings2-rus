 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Testimonials on Mushroom Towers"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.desc:0 "It doesn't matter how many times I lay my eyes upon such marvels, I will never grow accustomed to it. Like a giant fleshy limb surfacing from the depths of the land, the Telvanni mushroom towers raise more questions than give out answers.\n\nOne of such questions burns deep within my brain: "Why mushrooms?" Surely, there must be an answer. What it is, I wonder, that they like so much?"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.a:0 "Let me sniff them real close..."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.a.like:0 "You like the smell"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.a.hate:0 "It smells awful"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.b:0 "Let me have a little bite..."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.b.like:0 "It's delicious"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.b.hate:0 "It's disgusting"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.c:0 "Does it perhaps improve potency?"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.c.like:0 "It works"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.c.hate:0 "It makes it worse"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.d:0 "No matter, they are intimidating, and so I shall be!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.d.like:0 "People cower when you walk through"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.d.hate:0 "You end up looking silly"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0001.e:0 "Meh, I don't even like mushrooms."

 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Most Shrewd"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "While travelling through [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], I spotted travelling peddlar from a distance. [merchant.GetSheHe|U] bore the crest of House Hlaalu and asked if I was, perhaps, interested in some great deals.\n\nI glanced my entourage for a split second."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.a:0 "Well, I can invest some gold."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.a.good:0 "Your investment bears fruit"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.a.bad:0 "The market wasn't fruitful"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.b:0 "I cannot let this opportunity pass!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.b.good:0 "Immense Profit"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.b.bad:0 "Your investment falls short"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.c:0 "Let me learn from you!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0002.d:0 "Not interested, thank you."

 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Healing Hearts"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.desc:0 "Our entourage spotted an improvised healer camp nearby. Watching our approach, [healer.GetFirstName] came to me and introduced [healer.GetHerHim]self.\n\n"Noble [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], we are in dire need of ingredients for healing potions. Unfortunately, the ailing are too many and our resources too few. Could you help us?""
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.a:0 "Of course, have some gold."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.b:0 "Daedra hearts are known to be great ingredients!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.b.good:0 "You kill some nearby daedra"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.b.bad:0 "You manage to escape the daedra"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.c:0 "Let me take a look at those wounds..."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0003.d:0 "That is not my concern."
 
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.t:0 "$travel_danger_prefix$ Path of Exile"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.desc:0 "I've heard rumours that I should be careful while traversing [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], because some Ashlander exiles were setting up camp in that region.\n\nThe rumours proved themselves true when a mighty warrior made my entourage halt, and introduced [exile.GerHerHim]self as [exile.GetFirstName]. [exile.GetSheHe|U] asked us to surrender peacefully and face trial for trespassing on their lands."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.a:0 "I will exile you to Oblivion!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.defeated_exile:0 "You are victorious"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.defeated_by_exile:0 "You lose the battle"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.b:0 "Right, how much will it cost me?"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.c:0 "I think I know a shortcut that will lose them!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.d:0 "If you escort me, it isn't trespassing, is it?"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.offer_accepted:0 "[exile.GetFirstName] joined your party!"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0004.offer_refused:0 "[exile.GetFirstName] was not amused"

 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0005.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Maddening Whispers"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0005.desc:0 "Isolated, almost hidden, this is a rather rare passage point for any travel. Only the most unfortunate arrive here by chance and only the most deranged arrive here by choice.\n\nIt is only natural for such a horrible facility like the Gorne Asylum to be built this far from anything else. The constant screaming from the inside can be heard from a considerable distance.\n\nThe more I hear the desperate screams, I can almost hear a whispering behind them. The closer I get to the source, the more they become clearer to me."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0005.a:0 "I need to understand..."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0005.b:0 "May [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy!"

 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0006.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Dark Elves, Dark Hearts"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0006.desc:0 "I have not seen horrors and savagery such as I've seen in Morrowind. Enslavement, murder, deception, cruelty — name a sin and you'll find it venerated. Name a Daedra and you'll find it worshiped. This island is corrupt, straight down to the marrow.\n\nBut the thing that truly horrifies me, the thing that actually gives me goosebumps and will probably keep me up for long nights is the look on their faces while they commit the most heinous acts imaginable.\n\nBe it whipping an enslaved soul or fiddling with a creature's brain to make them do their bidding, the dunmer do it all with a bored face, almost like they wish it could be more... Amusing."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0006.a:0 "This is outrageous! Don't they know?"
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0006.b:0 "This could be... Profitable."
 ek_morrowind_travel_events.0006.c:0 "May [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on their souls..."
