As I ponder and reminisce about that event, a ghostly [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] appears before me. Before I can ready my [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')], the apparition starts speaking in a loud, deep voice.\n\n"Well met, hunter. I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine, and what I offer you is an eternal hunt. Serve me, and you shall be granted plenty of prey in my Hunting Grounds."\n\nAstonished, I struggle to find my words."

I heard someone shout "Spriggans!" before the kerfuffle started. Spriggans are known as sacred protectors of nature, highly revered by those who worship nature in their daily practices.\n\nI can't help but wonder if this area is being targeted by hunters too much."
