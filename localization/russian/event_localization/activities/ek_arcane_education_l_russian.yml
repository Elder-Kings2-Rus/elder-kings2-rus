 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc: "At last, I stand before the gates of [location.GetBaronyNameExplicitly], a venerable academy of the arcane arts.\n\nWithin these hallowed halls, the mysteries of magic are preserved and advanced by masterful mages of great knowledge and power. Here, with their guidance, I will unravel the secrets of the arcane and learn to reshape the very structure of Nirn."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_arcane_university: "Crossing the bridge from the Arboretum, the towering walls of the Arcane University stand before me, once an ancient Ayleid district and now Tamriel’s foremost center of magical learning.\n\nGuarded by Imperial Battlemages, this complex is a sanctuary for the study of enchantments, spells, and alchemy. And here I am, eager to immerse myself in the arcane arts and find my place among Tamriel’s greatest magical minds."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_winterhold_college: "As I approach the College of Winterhold, its imposing structure looms ahead, perched atop the cliffs and overlooking the ancient city below.\n\nThis venerable institution has stood for centuries, with its origins tracing back to the legendary mage Shalidor. Within its walls, the Hall of the Elements and the Arcanaeum library house invaluable knowledge, while beneath the campus, the Midden guards the College’s deepest secrets."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_firedancer_college: "Located in the shadows of Hammerfell’s sunscorched mountains, the Skaven Firedancer College is a place where art and destruction converge.\n\nStudents are taught to wield flame not only as a weapon of might but as an art form, where beauty and destruction are shaped by their command of fire’s heat and rhythm. Pyromancy is central, but the College also embraces all schools of magic, and now I am able to study here."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_sapiarch_college: "As I approach the College of Sapiarchs, a sense of awe sweeps over me. The walled compound rises in quiet grandeur and only with special permission from the portal master have I been granted this rare privilege to enter — a testament to the solitude in which the Sapiarchs pursue their studies, each devoted to a single, profound discipline. There are few, if any, places in all Tamriel where one might gain a deeper understanding of magic."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_beela_kars_laboratory: "As I arrive at the ancient xanmeer of Norg Tzel, home to Beela-Kaar's laboratory, an undeniable sense of unease washes over me.\n\nThe towering stone pyramid stands as a monument to knowledge without limits, its weathered walls hiding steadfest since centuries. Once again a place of learning, it now gathers scholars of every kind, yet the building itself holds probably more knowledge than all of them combined..."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_tel_aruhn: "As I approach Tel Aruhn, its towering spire looms like an ancient sentinel against the sky, its jagged outlines intertwined with Telvanni mushroom structures. This place has housed fabled mages of Aldmeri, Chimer, and now Dunmeri origin, and it feels as though their combined might has soaked into the very ground it stands upon.\n\nMagic pulses through every nook and cranny and I can't wait to immerse myself in its ancient, mystical embrace."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_end: "\n\nOf course, where there is knowledge, there are also #EMP distractions#! And I’m certain this place offers both in abundance."
 ek_arcane_education.0010.desc_very_very_far: "\n\nWhile it may not be unusual for mages from different corners of Tamriel to gather in this place, I notice the curiosity my appearance provokes. It seems that here, we [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are a rare sight."

 ek_arcane_education.1000.t: "Seeking a Volunteer"
 ek_arcane_education.1000.desc: "In a dusty corner of the library, [student.GetFirstName] approaches me, [student.GetHerHis] face alight with excitement as [student.GetSheHe] unfurls a set of scrolls covered in hastily scribbled notes. "Excuse me," [student.GetSheHe] says, voice a mix of eagerness and caution. "I've been toying with a few new spells — helpful ones, I think. But I need to test them on someone to see if they work as intended. Would you help me out? I assure you, it’ll be to your benefit. At least... I think so."\n\nThis piques my curiosity. Magic is about pushing boundaries, after all, but I can’t help but wonder just how safe this "experiment" will be."
 ek_arcane_education.1000.a: "Sure, what is the worst that could happen?"
 ek_arcane_education.1000.a.t: "This choice may have unforseen consequences."

 ek_arcane_education.1001.t: "Alchemic Temptation"
 ek_arcane_education.1001.desc: "Late in the evening, I find myself alone by the alchemy table, surrounded by the subtle glow of vials and the earthy aroma of crushed herbs. Though alchemy isn’t my current focus of study, I can’t deny its appeal. My gaze drifts over the rows of potions on display and jars brimming with rare ingredients.\n\nI could try brewing a potion of my own, learning something valuable in the process, or take one of these potions. Or… I could simply pocket a few of the most valuable ingredients, slip out quietly, and secure a tidy profit in the next town over."
 ek_arcane_education.1001.a: "The perfect time to try some potion crafting."
 ek_arcane_education.1001.b: "This magicka potion may come in handy."
 ek_arcane_education.1001.c: "I could really need one of these healing potions."

 ek_arcane_education.1002.t: "Necromancy Uncovered!"
 ek_arcane_education.1002.desc: "Through the door of a seldom-used classroom, I notice strange lights and, even more unusual, the smell of rotting flesh. Piqued by curiosity, I quietly approach. Inside, [secret_necromancer.GetFirstName] stands over a chalk-drawn circle, traced around the carcass of some unlucky animal. [secret_necromancer.GetHerHis|E] hands move in practiced motions while murmuring incantations that fill the room with an unnatural chill.\n\nThere is no doubt - [secret_necromancer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is practicing necromancy and obviously hoped to go unnoticed."
 ek_arcane_education.1002.a: "This has to be reported!"
 ek_arcane_education.1002.b: "A fellow enjoyer of the dark arts! Let's pool our knowledge."
 ek_arcane_education.1002.c: "I've seen nothing."

 ek_arcane_education.1003.t: "The Art of Enchanting"
 ek_arcane_education.1003.desc: "The soft hum of magic fills the classroom as [teacher.GetFirstName] demonstrates a basic enchantment, drawing the power from a filled soul gem directly into a silver necklace. I watch, entranced by the precision of [teacher.GetHerHis] work and the faint shimmer forming over the metal.\n\nWhen [teacher.GetSheHe] finishes, [teacher.GetSheHe] offers me a chance to try some enchantments myself - the necessary materials are all at hand.\nAlternatively, I could continue observing [teacher.GetHerHis] technique, focusing on the theoretical aspects of the craft."
 ek_arcane_education.1003.a: "Enchant some jewelry."

"Care to put your skills to the test in a training duel? Nothing too deadly - just a chance for some real experience."\n\n A duel is not without its dangers, but the chance to face a worthy opponent in combat — this is the kind of experience no book can offer. Victory would be sweet, but even in defeat, there is much to learn."
 ek_arcane_education.1004.a: "Prepare to face my might!"
 ek_arcane_education.1004.a.success: "You win the duel"
 ek_arcane_education.1004.a.failure: "You are beaten in the duel"
 ek_arcane_education.1004.b: "I would rather not."

 ek_arcane_education.1005.t: "Power in Writing"
 ek_arcane_education.1005.desc: "As I wander aimlessly through the shelves of the library, a strange book catches my eye. Its cover is made of dark, weathered leather, almost as if it is still alive. The runes etched into it are unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. What’s most unsettling, however, is that I could have sworn this book wasn’t here yesterday - yet it is coated in a fine layer of dust.\n\nA powerful pull seems to emanate from the tome, drawing me in. But I know enough about magic to recognize the danger in uncharted words. I glance back at the familiar scrolls on the nearby shelves - those safer texts, offering no such mysteries, but also no risks."
 ek_arcane_education.1005.a: "Read the mysterious tome."
 ek_arcane_education.1005.a.success: "The tome grants you powerful knowledge"

 ek_arcane_education.1006.t: "Alteration Class"
 ek_arcane_education.1006.desc: ""You are probably familiar with the spell to turn cheaper metals into gold," [teacher.GetFirstName] begins today's lecture. "A feat of greed, perhaps, but not one of great arcane finesse. Today, we will explore a broader application of transmutation. Your task is to turn this piece of lead into good, sturdy iron instead. For it is not wealth that builds empires, but tools and steel."\n\n[teacher.GetSheHe] then places the lump of lead in front of me [student.GetFirstName]. There it sits, inert and unremarkable, waiting to be transformed by the force of my will."
 ek_arcane_education.1006.a: "I will give it a try."
 ek_arcane_education.1006.a.success: "The transmutation is a success"
 ek_arcane_education.1006.a.failure: "The transmutation fails"
 ek_arcane_education.1006.b: "I just make gold. Lot's of it."

 ek_arcane_education.1006.d: "Please, can you repeat the instructions?"

 ek_arcane_education.1007.t: "Destruction Class"
 ek_arcane_education.1007.desc: ""You have learned to summon fire, conjure frost, and call forth lightning," [teacher.GetFirstName] begins, [teacher.GetHerHis] gaze sweeping across the room. "But destruction is not simply a matter of power - it is the art of choice. Each element carries its own purpose, its own consequence. Today, you will test your understanding of this by selecting the most effective element for combat. Your target will not be lifeless stone or static dummies, but each other - shielded, of course, by wards to prevent harm."\n\nWith a gesture, [teacher.GetSheHe] activates a shimmering protective barrier around [otherStudent.GetFirstName], who steps forward, steady but alert. [teacher.GetSheHe] motions for me to prepare."
 ek_arcane_education.1007.a: "There is nothing like the burning heat of a fireball!"

 ek_arcane_education.1007.a.failure: "Your fire is not hot enough"

 ek_arcane_education.1008.t: "Restoration Class"
 ek_arcane_education.1008.desc: "Not every lecture must be theoretical, and today presents a rare opportunity for hands-on experience. [wounded_peasant.GetFirstName|E] a local villager, savagely mauled by a [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')], has been brought to the university, [wounded_peasant.GetHerHis] condition far beyond the capabilities of ordinary physicians. This grim circumstance offers an invaluable learning opportunity.\n\nWe gather around, tasked with performing restoration magic under [teacher.GetFirstName]’s supervision. The wounds are severe, but the right spell should be able to close the torn flesh and knit the shattered bone, provided we work with precision and care."
 ek_arcane_education.1008.a: "Tend to the wounded peasant."
 ek_arcane_education.1008.a.success: "You heal [wounded_peasant.GetFirstName]"

 ek_arcane_education.1009.t: "Illusion Class"
 ek_arcane_education.1009.desc: "Today’s lesson focuses on charm spells, a cornerstone of the School of Illusion. These spells are designed to subtly influence the emotions and opinions of others, nudging them toward trust, admiration, or even affection.\n\nUnder [teacher.GetFirstName]’s instruction, I shall practice on [student.GetFirstName] to demonstrate my mastery of this craft. It may not be the most impressive spell of this school, but it is undeniably useful. Maybe even useful enough to extend its reach upon [teacher.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] [teacher.GetHerselfHimself]..."
 ek_arcane_education.1009.a: "Should be easy enough to manipulate [student.GetHerHis] mind."
 ek_arcane_education.1009.a.success: "You charm [student.GetFirstName]"

[teacher.GetFirstName], with a few words of power, summons [dremora.GetFirstName] into the center of the classroom - a formidable Daedra, created from otherworldly essence.\n\nThis is no mere demonstration; it is a chance to interact with a being from Oblivion itself. The Dremora stands poised, [dremora.GetHerHis] eyes glowing with cold fire, awaiting commands. [teacher.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] invites us to ask questions, offering a chance to learn firsthand from such a powerful entity."
 ek_arcane_education.1010.a: "Convince [dremora.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to give up some secrets."

 ek_arcane_education.1011.desc: "While taking a break from my studies, I find myself drawn to the grand training grounds of the Arcane University. Here, the finest men and women of the Imperial Legion are honed into Battlemages, famed for their lethal blend of martial skill and arcane mastery. Their unwavering discipline and dedication set them apart as something truly unique in Tamriel.\n\nAs I watch their rigorous training unfold, I realize there is much to be learned here - perhaps even more than in the greatest of libraries."

 ek_arcane_education.1012.desc: "The college in Skaven is renowned for many things, but none more famous than the Firedancers, whose reputation extends even beyond the borders of Hammerfell. These skilled acrobats turn pyromancy into a breathtaking spectacle, weaving complex spells with seemingly effortless grace - all while dancing in scandalously minimal attire.\n\nNaturally, I couldn't leave without witnessing one of their performances. What I see here is nothing short of mesmerizing, living up to every tale I've ever heard."

 ek_arcane_education.1013.desc: "While wandering one of the College's elegant corridors, I unexpectedly cross paths with [sapiarch.GetFirstName]. It takes a moment to recognize [sapiarch.GetHerHim] - a distinguished figure among the Sapiarchs - and to my surprise, [sapiarch.GetSheHe] seems inclined to chat.\n\nWithout so much as an introduction, [sapiarch.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] delves into an enthusiastic explanation of [sapiarch.GetHerHis] field of study. Before I can react, I am drawn into an impromptu lecture exploring the complexities of Transliminal Arts, the subtleties of Ornamental Greenery, and the depths of Mythohistory."

 ek_arcane_education.1014.desc: "Each time I wander through the corridors of this ancient Xanmeer, I uncover hidden chambers, winding pathways, and shadowed cellars - some still steeped in secrets older than memory itself. Yet today, my discoveries go beyond the usual faded inscriptions on crumbling walls or rusted, bloodstained tools lost in time.\n\nToday, I find myself face to face with a host of angry wraiths, their ethereal forms bound to this place by some long-forgotten injustice.\nThese tormented souls may still guard fragments of ancient knowledge, but to seek their attention could also invite peril."

 ek_arcane_education.1015.desc: "Every student in Winterhold knows about the Midden - a shadowy labyrinth of icy caverns, ancient ruins, and forgotten sewers, hidden deep beneath the college. It’s a place steeped in mystery and cautionary tales. Some venture there to conduct forbidden experiments or to conceal the aftermath of failed spells. Others, with more noble intentions, seek to establish magical stations of wondrous design. And then there are those who seek to explore its depths and are never seen again.\n\n[student.GetFirstName] has always shown a keen interest in these stories, and today, [student.GetSheHe] has asked me to accompany [student.GetHerHim] in exploring this perilous place ourselves."
