 contest_events.6110.t:1 "$tournament_contest_header$ Throw an Elemental Punch"
 contest_events.6110.desc:0 "Magic is a very versatile tool, and while [versus_contestant.GetFirstName] is certainly capable of using it, [versus_contestant.GetSheHe] may not be as well versed in the more mundane aspects of fighting as I am. As we start circling each other and testing our opponents' defensive magic, I can't help but consider the possibilities that a combined attack of arcane and physical force could offer.\n\nA swift punch into [versus_contestant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s stomach, with my fist cloaked in elemental magic, might secure me a swift victory, although it could also be deemed dishonorable."
 contest_events.6110.a:0 ""Hah, taste #bold this#!!""
 contest_events.6110.b:0 "That seems unfair..."
 contest_events.6110.c:0 "How about a ranged spell instead?"
 contest_events.6110.c.success:0 "Your ranged spell is a success."
 contest_events.6110.c.failure:0 "Your ranged spell fails."

 contest_events.6120.t:1 "$tournament_contest_header$ Magical Exhaustion"
 contest_events.6120.desc:0 "During the arcane battle against [versus_contestant.GetFirstName], I sense a rare opportunity. There is a noticeable weakness in the magical barrier [versus_contestant.GetSheHe] has erected for [versus_contestant.GetHerHis] defense, and I may be able to shatter it completely if I apply enough force. However, doing so would require a significant amount of magicka, and I would need a longer period of time to recover from such exertion.\n\nThis leaves me with a decision to make. Is it necessary to resort to such drastic methods, or are there alternative ways to achieve victory here?"
 contest_events.6120.a:0 "It's necessary!"
 contest_events.6120.b:0 "That would be shortsightened."

 contest_events.6130.t:1 "$tournament_contest_header$ A Gruesome Threat"
 contest_events.6130.desc:0 "Numerous individuals have grown to fear me over time, and as [versus_contestant.GetFirstName] readies [versus_contestant.GetHerselfHimself] to confront me in arcane combat, I ponder how I can capitalize on that. After all, there exist countless creative methods to torment someone by harnessing the magical possibilities available to us.\n\nA particularly malicious threat might suffice to push [versus_contestant.GetFirstNameNoToolTip] beyond their limits and compel [versus_contestant.GetherHim] to surrender – thus ensuring my victory without the need to actually cast any spells."
 contest_events.6130.a:0 "I will break your mind!"
 contest_events.6130.b:0 "You will be turned inside out!"
 contest_events.6130.c:0 "My summons will haunt you forever!"
 contest_events.6130.success:0 "You succesfully intimidate [versus_contestant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 contest_events.6130.failure:0 "[versus_contestant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] is not intimidated."

 contest_events.6140.t:1 "$tournament_contest_header$ Manipulate the Judge?"
 contest_events.6140.desc:0 "As I begin trading the first spells and counterspells with [versus_contestant.GetFirstName], a thought occurs to me: Could there be a simpler way to secure victory? Having acquired a certain mastery over illusion magic, I reflect on a fundamental lesson from my studies – the importance of unconventional thinking to attain greatness.\n\nWhy expend effort on my opponent when I could instead penetrate the judge's mind? If successful, I could undoubtedly persuade them that [versus_contestant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] merits for disqualification."
 contest_events.6140.a:0 "That's what illusion magic is made for."
 contest_events.6140.a.success:0 "You succesfully manipulate the judges mind."
 contest_events.6140.a.failure:0 "Your attempt to manipualte the judge is discovered."
 contest_events.6140.b:0 "It's not worth the risk."
