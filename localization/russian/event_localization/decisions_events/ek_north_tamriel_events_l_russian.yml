 north_tamriel.0001.desc.intro:0 "The passing of High King Logrolf marked the beginning of a years long civil war in Skyrim, as the western and eastern halves of the land of the Nords refused to acknowledge the other side's claimant."
 north_tamriel.0001.desc.war:0 "\n\nMany in Skyrim feared that the stalemate could never be broken, and that the Nords would stay divided for centuries. But it seems that fate was on the side of [winner.GetFullName], as [winner.GetHerHis] armies clashed with those of [loser.GetFullName], and prevailed! As [winner.GetSheHe] marched through [loser.GetFirstName]'s territory, each Jarl and Chief still loyal to the now defeated pretender swore alliegeance to [winner.GetFirstName], until there was none left to contest [winner.GetHerHis] claim."
 north_tamriel.0001.desc.other:0 "\n\nYears have passed, and while many thought an open war between the two halves of the province over the crown would never happen, fate decided that the home of the Nords should be unified peacefully."

 north_tamriel.0005.t:0 "The Partition of Skyrim"
 north_tamriel.0005.desc:0 "After the death of High King Logrolf, Skyrim was broken into two halves. The New Holds supported the new Western pretender, while the Old Holds threw their support behind the daughter of the last High King.\nNow, after years of uneasy peace and cold war, the two claimants of the old throne of Ysgramor met and marked the end of this conflict.\n\n[wk_holder.GetTitledFirstName] and [ek_holder.GetTitledFirstName] recognized each other as [wk_holder.GetTitleTierName] of Western Skyrim and [ek_holder.GetTitleTierName] of Eastern Skyrim, respectively.\n\nOnly time will tell if this peace will last, or if one side will try to one day claim the old High Kingdom for their own..."

 north_tamriel.0011.desc:0 "As we cross the Sea of Ghosts into Skyrim, we seized the islands of Bleakrock and Japhet's Folly.\n\nThe local ports and harbours have been rebuilt, and they will serve as a resting point between the mainland and Solstheim."

 north_tamriel.0021.desc:0 "While the eastern half of the Reach had been given to Skyrim centuries ago, the region stayed firmly in the hand of the savage men of the Reach and their Orc cousins. Any Nord expedition into these lands to settle the region and turn it into a proper hold was fruitless, and soon the land would revert back to its primitive holders.\n\nThanks to my efforts the Reach has finally been uprooted out of its primitive ways, and settlers from all over Skyrim are now pouring into the region, eager to settle this new land and extract the riches that the savage Reachfolk never even considered.\n\nA delegation from the other holds was received in [markarth.GetNameNoTier], and in the ancient Dwarven city it was proclaimed that the Reach would now be the Ninth Hold of Skyrim."

 north_tamriel.1001.desc:0 "The old Altmeri clan of the Direnni rose to power in High Rock ages ago, in the early centuries of the First Era. They quickly became the dominant power of the region, even defeating the Alessian Empire at the battle of Glenumbra Moors.\n\nAs time passed they lost most of their power to the Breton nobility, until they would only hold the Adamantine Tower and a few settlements on the coast.\n\nBut their legacy remains, and I am well on my way to reclaim it. After having secured most of the core Direnni holdings, including the Tower of Ada-Mantia, I have proclaimed the recreation of the Hegemony. While some are still reluctant to accept my claim, soon they will all fall under their new Hegemon, and my family and I will rule as masters of High Rock."
 north_tamriel.1001.desc_direnni:0 "My ancestors used to be the masters of High Rock. We discovered alchemy, conjuration, and none could challenge our hold over the province, not even the full might of the Alessian Empire. As the centuries passed however, we were forced to abandon most of our land, until we would only hold the old Tower of Ada-Mantia, where time itself was set straight.\n\nBut none shall forget us, and today I have officially proclaimed the start of a long campaign, where all of our kin shall take the arms and reconquer what we once held! Thanks to my guidance and the strength of my blood, we will reforge the Direnni Hegemony and once again become masters of High Rock!"

I have summoned all of my vassals, from Daggerfall to Markarth and from Northpoint to Hallin, and they all swore eternal alliegeance to their new Hegemon. Long gone are the days of the petty kings of High Rock, as a new Hegemony has been forged from the ashes of the Direnni!"
 north_tamriel.1011.desc_direnni:0 "If my ancestors could watch me... Centuries after our line went almost extinct, I have finally reclaimed all of our family holdings! I have surpassed what my ancestors even dreamt of doing, and today all of the Hegemony is one again under our rule! None shall question our power again, as the power of the petty kings and other upstart rulers in the region have been broken!\n\nDe Rerum Dirennis!"
