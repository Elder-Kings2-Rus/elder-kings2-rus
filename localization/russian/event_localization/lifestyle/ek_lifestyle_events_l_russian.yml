 ek_lifestyles.0022.desc:0 "[tarhiel.GetUIName], a wizard of my acquaintance, has recently proposed that despite common misconceptions, Alteration magic can indeed be used to grant flight to the flightless, and that [tarhiel.getSheHe] has discovered the secret combination of Alteration spells that would allow such a feat.\n\nHowever, to test this spell would require investment beyond [tarhiel.GetHerHis] means. The spells must be inscribed onto scrolls, and consume such raw amounts of magicka that the manufacture alone is impossible without expensive soul gems or Dwarven artifacts.\n\n[tarhiel.GetUIName] has approached me, as a fellow Alteration master, with a request for patronage. Should the spell of flight work as [tarhiel.GetSheHe] believes, I will be honoured as the driving force behind its invention."

Experimental Alteration magics bathe [tarhiel.GetHerHim] in a blue glow for just a second. [tarhiel.GetSheHe] looks at me once, and nods. I nod back. Today, history is written.\n\n[tarhiel.GetUIName] stretches out [tarhiel.GetHerHis] arms, breathes in, and jumps. By the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm], how [tarhiel.GetSheHe] flies! [tarhiel.GetUIName] soars far above me, laughing at those nay-sayers who scorned our theory…\n\nAnd then [tarhiel.GetSheHe] falls back to the ground. The impact is a sight that I won't soon forget.

I cannot begin to describe the feeling: it's majesty, it's thrill, it's freedom, it's childlike joy, all at once… I am like a bird, and the heavens are within my grasp…\n\nBut then, my stomach churns.

For instance, through apophatic intrusions projected into one's surroundings, one can turn the fundamental magics of Illusion into something that reveals the truth instead of concealing it - the simple “Clairvoyance” spell.\n\nGranted, its scope is limited. I have found no references to it being refined to such a degree where it could rival the alleged prophetic gifts of the wise-women of Morrowind or even the cultists of Azura. It seems like one can only use it to strengthen intuition, confirm reasonable doubts, and connect thoughts that were already there. But perhaps I could attempt to tune it as high as possible?"

Magic can deceive the senses to the point where it makes me doubt things before my own eyes and within my own hands. How can anyone think themselves safe when invisible assassins are undetectable? How can we know any given sight is not a conjured illusion, how can we even trust our own hearts when illusionists can calm and enrage people almost at will?\n\nI do not understand how people, least of all mages, can go about their lives pretending that anything can be known or trusted.

Though his books are almost impossible to find these days, I now possess a solid commentary on his theories.\n\nSolid enough to work from, perhaps? Replicating the Nightwielder’s arts from a derivative work would be impossible, but then, I consider myself a prodigal mind in the field of Illusion…"

 ek_lifestyles.0029.desc:0 "I have been struggling with this primer on Restoration for some time. The book is comprehensible enough, and provides clear outlines and formulaic descriptions of the standard Restoration spells, but there is one issue with it that has stumped me: it makes repeated reference to “the living energies”, assuming that the reader understands, and makes several explanations of Restoration's methods and mysteries contingent on this concept.\n\nI have searched this term elsewhere, to no avail. Here and there, obscure references. Most of them are of a religious nature, or at least metaphysical. This much seems to be obvious: the “living energies” are what we in the school affect through magicka, in living bodies, to cause the effects of our spells.\n\nBut what precisely are they?"
 ek_lifestyles.0029.a:0 "It is the fundamental Divine bequeathment to mortals."
