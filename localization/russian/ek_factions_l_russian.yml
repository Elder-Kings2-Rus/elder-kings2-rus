 bandits_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Murderers, thieves, and villains of all kinds — this [crisis_faction|E] started as brigands in the hinterlands, but now its members' unchecked ambition has set their sights on something far, far greater: rule by law as well as by force."
 goblinken_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Hunched, short, subterranean scurriers — this [crisis_faction|E] represents cavefulls of those whom many in Tamriel might shun as mere beasts, but whose aspirations for self-determination have led them to the inescapable conclusion that they must take their fight for survival to the "legitimate" owners of their traditional lands.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with low [control|E]."
 necromancers_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Profane, ghoulish, and dehumanising — this [crisis_faction|E]n's members often hear harsh words, and in return they call their critics "superstitious", "sanctimonious", and "stupid" moralisers. Now, with the moralisers guarding their gravesites against Necromantic exploration and extraction projects, the Necromancers see little choice but to secure their resources by force.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with low [control|E], from events or from [spells|E]."
 vampires_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Barely human, nearly fiends, and completely given over to evil hunger — the vampires of this [crisis_faction|E] are tired of living in the shadows. Thus they seek to turn the region to their service, subjugating its inhabitants as cattle, or worse...\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with low [control|E]."
 werewolves_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "People one moment, distorted beasts the next — this [crisis_faction|E] may have started as outcasts banding together to survive, or they may always have been marauding murderers. Regardless, these curséd beasts now seek their freedom from societal scrutiny forever, by making of the local towns their hunting-grounds.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with low [control|E]"
 falmer_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Eyeless, long thought extinct, and conditioned by resentment of vanished slavers — this [crisis_faction|E] upends our understanding of Tamriel, pouring out from below it in a calculated frenzy. Rising like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number, their Return mirrors that which forced them underground so many millennia ago.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may very rarely appear in counties in [GetGeographicalRegion('mundus_tamriel_skyrim').GetName] from events." 
 imga_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "To some, apelike beastfolk; to others, furred humans — this [crisis_faction|E]'s members once practiced their culture, and traditions traded from elves of old, in the Valenwoods. Their lands reduced to enclaves insufficient to sustain them, these Imga know that confrontation is inevitable.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties in [GetGeographicalRegion('mundus_tamriel_valenwood').GetName] with low [control|E]."
 peryite_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Disease, plague, pestilence, and pus — this [crisis_faction|E] brings the gifts of Peryite to anybody whom they choose to "bless", and now these cultists have decided to bestow their beneficence on the entire populace of the region, if only the local administrators will step aside for these otherwise-reasonable Daedra-worshippers.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties ravaged by [epidemics|E]."
 daedra_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Monstrosities, abominations, and dæmons — this [crisis_faction|E] is not of our plane. Summoned from Oblivion and the Outer Realms, these creatures view mortals as little but obstacles to be surmounted in pursuit of power and pleasure, and with their otherworldly abilities they may well succeed.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with low [control|E] or from [spells|E]"
 ashlanders_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "Outcasts all, expelled in disgrace — this [crisis_faction|E] is an Ashlander army, Dark Elves of disparate origin, every one united behind their warchief and determined to end their exile.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties in [GetGeographicalRegion('mundus_tamriel_vvardenfell').GetName] with low [control|E]."
 slaves_flag_crisis_faction_desc:0 "The history of this [crisis_faction|E] is the history of class struggle. Freeman and slave, oppressor and oppressed, in constant opposition, carrying on an uninterrupted, once hidden, now open fight, a fight that ends either in revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n\n#help This [crisis_faction|E] may appear in counties with a Slave Plantation [building|E]."

 FACTION_DEMAND_EK_CRISIS_DESC_PERYITE: "The real disease is the puritans who spurn nature! Your cough, your rash, your consumption; they're all natural, and so is our possession of these lands. The virulent overcome the weak, and we are virulent and you are weak!"
