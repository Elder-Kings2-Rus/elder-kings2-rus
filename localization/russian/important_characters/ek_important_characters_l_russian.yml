 imp_char_flamehair_999_desc:0 "The Flame-Hair Clan held the High Kingship for three generations and over a century when Logrolf sat in the Palace of Kings in 2E 394. Simply unprecedented since the august Ysgramoor Dynasty!\n\nOne can hardly fault the Nords for passing the crown down a lineage in accordance with the Pact of Chieftains, but even less so when their scions show nothing but good character. Logrolf was a paragon of Nordic kingship: leading his thanes in battle, splitting the spoils, passing judgement upon the wicked and compensating the impaired.\n\nThe balance of power, commerce and influence shifted to Windhelm as it became clear the capital would stay there for the foreseeable future.  Solitude's docks and Whiterun's  marketplaces payed the tribute of this change.\n\nThe former had been particularly injured not only in treasury but also in its pride. The Blue Palace was indeed the residence of the High King for much of the Late First Era. Logrolf was the last straw and his daughter Freydis seemed cut out from the same cloth as her forefathers. Action was urgently needed.\n\nEmboldened by the death of Potentate Savirien-Chorak a year prior, Svartr Cursebraid, Jarl of Solitude and Grand Steward of Skyrim hatched a plot to murder High King Logrolf and contest Freydis' succession to the throne. Logrolf died with no grievances, only guilty of being too good a liege. Svartr then declared himself High King with the backing of the Western Holds whilst Logrolf's daughter was acknowledged by the Eastern Holds. The Children of the Sky were locked in bitter feud once again."

 imp_char_akavir_99_desc:0 "Versidue-Shaie handed the Ilniviri four centuries of unrivalled prominence following Reman III's death. Briskly liquidating the Imperial Household and taking over the remaining institutions, he declared 2920 to be the 'Last Year of the First Era'. \n\nFormally assuming total power in 2E 1 despite stark opposition, Versidue-Shaie kickstarted a whirlwind of political arrests, murders and palace coups remembered as the 'Reman Purges'. Blackrose, Whiterose and—most of all—Amenos Isle emerged as penal colonies for unrepentant Remanites.\n\nEven so, transition to the new regime remained fraught with insubordination, peaking in 2E 283 with the 'Challenge of Bardmont'. The end of the following thirty-seven years long conflict saw the disbandment of private armies, finally culling the last recalcitrant princes.\n\nSapped of financial and military might, the pacified empire lacked the ability to police itself. Proconsul Dinieras-Ves thus petitioned the hegemon in 2E 320 to delegate peacekeeping to the nascent Fighters' Guild.\n\n'The Coiled King' shed the mantle of power in the same way he had worn it: by the assassin's dagger. Found dead in 2E 324, he was succeeded by his son Savirien-Chorak, unaware that his life's work would be laid low within a third of the time he had ruled."

Still, the truth is something more prosaic: Versidue-Shaie ruling the Empire for so long was a miracle that could hardly repeat itself.\n\nOverwhelmed by the government tailored for his omnipresent sire, Savirien-Chorak fell victim to executive paralysis. Crises would be brought to his attention one day, only to receive a tepid reply weeks later, long after the local authorities had overruled him.\n\nNot one to be dismissed entirely, Savirien-Chorak was savvy enough to elevate Orsinium to the provincial rank and to execute the insolent. On the latter note, he was #bold far less#! murderous than his father: 'Queen of Fangs'—the household blade—beheaded less nobles during his #entire reign#! than during #the sole Bardmont Challenge#!, when royal gore frequently bathed the sword.\n\nThat made the case of Cyril II Cuptor all the more important. Publicly endorsing a satire of your liege is a sure path to execution, as the Imperial Count of Bravil learned the hard way in 2E 400! Furthermore, Savirien-Chorak appointed Sien-Drassi as Proconsul instead of allowing the succession of Prince Venaros to his impudent father, thoroughly humiliating House Cuptor.\n\nYears passed and resentment pooled until Savirien-Chorak's lifeless body was found in 2E 430 in his palace of Senchal, killed by Mephalan fanatics called 'the Morag Tong'. They did not let off his direct heirs either, just like the Remans of old. Simmering tensions finally erupted with the writing on the wall: the Second Empire had begun its final dislocation.\n\nYet a little known descendant known as Aixnieras-Ves would make a surprising turnaround..."

Valenwood flourished, freed from the cycle of endemic warfare by Falinesti's benevolent rule\n\n Mourning shrouded the wards in 2E 420 once it was known Falinesti and its inhabitants vanished, presumed dead. Wailings and cries sounded across the country, and Silvenar Edhelorn took ill for three years before his condition bettered. 'The Peacemaker' became 'the Lamented'.\n\nBranch families all staked their claim on the High Kingship, with the Camorans of Silvenar and Camorans of Grahtwood at the head of the pack.

Tragically, he was killed in a dispute with some racketeering guards; They wanted a third of his loot rather the legal toll of a tenth. Borvir pleaded with the Captain of the guard to punish the wrongdoers but was thrown in a cell and died there before the Count's grace saved him. \n\nBelieving in the tales of fair kingship, Borvir petitioned Imperial Count Janus to intercede on his behalf, recounting his woes. To his credit, Janus proposed a settlement, which decreed the following: Borvir would be compensated with twice the value of the stolen troll fat, Aenar's funeral would be paid for by the state and a special waiver on duelling was granted so that Borvir could deal with the murderers.\n\nBorvir wanted...more. He wanted nothing less than the Captain's head! It was a cost Janus was unwilling to bear so he reiterated his offer which Borvir declined.\n\nThe next month, the involved guardsmen were found dead and robbed blind. Borvir had sworn a blood oath on Janus and led a warband of fellow wronged Nords. In 2E 432, he conquered Bruma and fulfilled his oath. A moot was convened thereafter, as the clan-heads confirmed Borvir as 'King of Bruma' and his son's right to succeed him.

Orsinium could #bold never #! exist without the Bretons' tacit approval. Nobody wanted a repeat of King Golkarr's foolhardiness.\n\nBashag was not the strongest prince on paper, but his service as a Potentate legionnaire then as diplomat made him a viable candidate. The crucial breakthrough for his royal ambitions came in the winter of 2E 425. Savirien-Chorak had submitted a sealed missive promising provincial status only #EMP if #! 'Legate Bashag Golzarga is elected King of the Orcs'. The deal was too good to pass up and the clans readily agreed. Bashag insisted on fighting any stubborn claimants, with the Chieftains and Imperial Delegation as witnesses.\n\n Five years elapsed and Bashag became a shadow of his former self. Existential dread plagued the most powerful Orsimer in Tamriel...Everything became clear in 2E 431 when the coalition led by Shornhelm bashed in the gates: they were too weak! Golzarga Orsinium lasted only a year against the Breto-Redguard alliance's full might. Entire Orc clans perished during the sack or scattered back into their ancestral Wrothgar strongholds.\n\nThe Yal Clan survived, but had no home in Wrothgar. Its forefathers lived in Skyrim, the destination of their exodus at the behest of Chieftain Yashnag."

 imp_char_cuptor_98:0 ""
 imp_char_cuptor_98_desc:0 "No one really knows what compelled Imperial Count Cyril II of Bravil to voraciously consume Potentate satire. Perhaps some unknown setback at the hands of a magnate? Stonewalling by his Cisnibenese prefects?  And yet his line was one of the more trusted ones in Savirien-Chorak's Cyrodiil...\n\nCyril had official seals, exemption from many taxes and the right to maintain a retinue—a distinctive status symbol in post-Bardmont Tamriel. The Potentate really saw the Cuptor as kin. All the while, creeping addiction sapped the deep respect Cyril had for Savirien. \n\nCyril ran amok to the point of patronizing the anonymous author behind the 'Sevilio Coraccus' saga. Sevilio Coraccus is a mercurial king with a lisp prone to inaction, a thinly veiled critic of his liege melding reality and fiction to great effect. Most readers agree that it reached the apex in 'Sevilio Coraccus: Shadow of Varsidius' and 'Sevilio Coraccus: the Memoirs of Sidorius'.\n\nCyril grew more insolent off his readinds until he went too far. As the Elder Council was convening to address yet another crisis festering because of non-commital Savirien he quipped that 'the original really cannot be matched by Sevilio'. Savirien-Chorak—or his trusted aide—heard this and secretly arranged for an investigation. Numerous copies of 'Sevilio Coraccus' were found in the walls of his mansion along with correspondences and letters of change proving his financial ties to the author.\n\nCondemned for high treason, Cyril II was stripped of his comital office and personally beheaded by the Potentate using Queen of Fangs. Officially spared unlike his father, Prince Venaros was allowed to depart albeit chased by 'loyalists', willing to dispatch him to enter the good graces of their sovereign."

In short, Alisxar was en route to greatness, but a sudden and grievous dispute with his son and heir caused him to exile his child, and to name his infant daughter as the new heiress, a decision that could jeopardize his entire hard-won legacy."

 imp_char_atla_205_desc:0 "Auril II was a proud man and a great king, who inherited a small post-Ayleidic city-state and transformed it into a kingdom worthy of its name. Not content to let the great cities outside the gates of Solhrest rot in the encroaching mires of Black Marsh, nor to let the prodigal tribes of the north fall to the predations of the Naga, Auril took matters into his own hands and extended his benevolence and custodianship to all Yespest tribes that still remained, by force and by persuasion.\n\nIn his lifetime, Auril balanced the tightrope act of legitimising his kingship in the style of an Ayleid tyrant, while focusing his people on the future and breaking with many of the more hated customs inherited from the Wild Elves. His fearsome and glorious aura alone, so it is said, kept Solhrest safe from would-be invaders; alas, this charisma could not be passed down like his throne was.\n\nAuril met his end attempting to torch the Bridges of Leyawiin, slain by Overlord Esdrufus who would not have the Yespest king threaten his designs for economic domination of the Topal Bay."

 imp_char_indoril_alma_rula_desc:0 "Young champions flock to the Four Ordinator Orders like a moth to a flame, eager to prove their devotion. Dedicated to the Almsivi since his birth in 2E 345, it was a sacred obligation to Farwil Indoril.\n\nNeedless to say, spiritual instruction awaited the young mer; He often pondered over Temple scholastics and Chimer history to the delight of his tutors. Yet he also sparred daily with his father Braynos, a retired general.\n\nGrandmaster Mathyn's cousin took the Oath of Ordination in 2E 361, being admitted to all Orders. To fulfil his late father's wishes, he became a Militant instead of following his Doctrinaire inclination. His distinguished service in the Order of War alongside experience in the other Orders—especially the Order of Doctrine and Ordination—were held in high regard by his peers. In time his name was spoken with reverence, and joined the race to be the next Alma Rula.\n\nWhen the August Conclave of the Three Living Gods for the Selection of their Worldly Voice finally convened in 2E 380, Farwil Indoril became the youngest Alma Rula in Temple history, after barely two decades of service. Strongly backed by the Orders of War and Doctrine, the Order of the Watch broke the stalemate when it declared for Farwil rather than the Inquisition's candidate.\n\nA mannish life later, Farwil commands an ascendant Tribunal Temple supported by sizeable holdings on Necrom and Vvardenfell, in addition to the three Archcanonries."

 imp_char_skjoralmor_99_desc:0 "Clan Skjoralmor's ancestors were affluent lumberjacks, operating many sawmills across Falkreath Hold. Interest came due when Steward Thadgeir was bequeathed rule of the Kingdom after the previous family line went extinct. He reformed the administration to great effect while cutting down on military expenditures, a move that was sound at the time. The treasury swelled with coins and the people thrived.\n\nWhen Thadgeir died in 2E 425, his son Falk succeeded him. Falk was a capable ruler but too miserly to restore military expenditure amidst a period of growing insecurity. No level of pleading from his Housecarl or even Prince Hakkvild could make him budge.\n\nReports in late 2E 431 indicating that the Orcish Yal Tribe had declared for Falkreath got lost within the political storm that caused by the Moot of Solitude. King Falk nominally assented to the coronation of Svartr whom otherwise did not assert himself on Greypine Hall too much.\n\nThat all changed when the Yal Tribe finally entered the Home of the Nords in early 2E 432 passing through the Reachgate. The Reachbreaker Kings were too precarious to oppose them but sent word to the other Holds.\n\nHigh King Svartr formulated a strategy with the remaining western monarchs. Mere days into the war council, Jarl Hjorta of Morthal withdrew her support citing concerns about the quality of Falkreath forces, the main target of the Orcish offensive. Thus only the armies of Haafingar, Whiterun and the shoddy militia of Falkreath would participate in the War of the Pines. The few opening skirmishes were inconclusive as the Orsimer did not lay siege to any stronghold on the way to Falkreath, but harshly raided the Whiterun countryside for supplies at the price of constant harassment. A set piece battle at last happened, the Battle of Fairmoor where the Nordic coalition failed to check the Orcish foraging efforts.\n\nFurious with King Falk for his insubordination doubled with uselessness, Svartr and Torygg committed to a final engagement in defense of the Southern Hold: the Battle of Granite Hall in 2E 433. The Falkreath center of the army broke yet again before anyone else, and this time there would be no help forthcoming. King Falk had made his grave and he would lie in it.\n\nStruggling at death's door for a year further, King Falk was slain by Yashnag Yal during the Siege of Falkreath. 2E 434 would be the year Hakkvild mourned the loss of father and crown."
