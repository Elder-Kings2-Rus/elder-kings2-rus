 ek_special_buildings_events.0001.desc:0 "Под развалинами Логова Клыка покоятся многочисленные сокровища, и вот настал момент завладеть самым ценным из них: останками самого Турвокуна, грозного дракона, который когда-то обитал в этих местах. Он отнял бесчисленное множество жизней, но и сам умер не своей смертью. Однако кости дракона так и не обрели полного покоя. Они всё ещё жаждут крови и мести, и я дам им возможность удовлетворить это желание.\n\nДракон остаётся грозным существом даже после смерти. Но он недостаточно силён, чтобы противостоять моим некромантическим способностям. С таким слугой меня, несомненно, никто не сумеет остановить."

Эти грозные воины, состоящие из блуждающего камня и тесно связанные с Дикими, готовы противостоять любому противнику, который осмелится бросить вызов господству Лесного короля над этим царством.\n\nКогда мы призываем Полых на помощь, они храбро сражаются пока не одолеют врага. Или пока враг не одолеет их. К счастью для нас, даже смерть не может остановить этих стойких защитников леса. Если возникнет новая угроза, Полые будет готова вновь выйти из недр земли."

 ek_special_buildings_events.0023.desc:0 "I was prepared for many things, but not for the great chasm that awaited me just beyond the entry. I can see the other side, but surely not even a Forgotten Mane who trained their whole life could leap such a distance! There is no bridge or crossing, only a small shrine to Khenarti, the Winged Goddess of wind and air.\n\nWhat is the meaning of this? Is it a test of faith? Should I just... step forward?"
 ek_special_buildings_events.0023.a:0 "Just close your eyes and hope for the best"

 ek_special_buildings_events.0024.desc:0 "A dark hall awaits me next. I can hear the echo of my own heart beating within these walls, as if someone is pounding a doomful drum... Is this just another test of will? But no, something is coming from the shadows: dark beings with glowing blue lines on their fur. These are dro-m'Athra! The souls of Khajiit that have fallen to Namira. They move as if dancing to the rhythm of my heartbeat, mockingly yet with eerie beauty.\n\nAnd then, I notice the blades in their claws."
 ek_special_buildings_events.0024.a:0 "Draw your own blade and fight"

 ek_special_buildings_events.0025.desc:0 "I move from door to door, walking through long corridors adorned with withered reliefs and seemingly senseless divergences, all the while anticipating the next trial. But there are no more chasms, no more enemies to confront. It takes me a moment to realize that this section itself is the next trial! The structure has transformed into a colossal maze, and I am already lost within its labyrinthine passages."
 ek_special_buildings_events.0025.a:0 "Try to find a pattern in all of this"

 ek_special_buildings_events.0026.desc:0 "As I enter the cave that lies beyond the maze, I instantly sense that the trials are at an end. There is no looming threat in this place; it is a sacred ground, open to the sky and adorned with statues and blooming flowers. In the center of it all stands a gigantic hourglass, so strangely beautiful in its otherworldly form that it must surely be a gift from Alkosh, the Cat of Time, himself. As I cautiously reach out to touch it, I feel its blessing warming my skin."
 ek_special_buildings_events.0026.a:0 ""I have proven my worth!""

 ### Cut Sunspire Funding

 ek_special_buildings_events.0031_hs.desc:0 "May Alkosh be lenient with my decision to withhold further funding for this venerable site dedicated to his worship.\n\nAs the Cat of Time, he surely understands that time brings change, even to the holiest of places. And after all, this transformation will unfold gradually. The remaining monks of Sunspire will steadfastly guard the temple and welcome the pilgrims who still seek its sacred grounds.\nEven as the structure begins to fade, the legacy of Sunspire will endure throughout the ages."
 ek_special_buildings_events.0031_no_hs.desc:0 "The monks of Sunspire are far from pleased with my decision, but they must accept the new reality: it was my gold that held their temple together and it won't flow any longer.\n\nDespite the change, Sunspire will continue to be a sacred site for their faith, drawing pilgrims to its heights. Though they may now offer their prayers amid walls that are slowly crumbling, even in decay, this temple's grandeur will endure for a very long time."

Hundreds of builders, architects, masons, carpenters, and jewelers were involved in this monumental project, and the result of their labor is truly breathtaking. Each room is adorned with more reliefs, pillars, and statues than the previous one, while the gardens are filled with beautiful flowers and exotic animals.\n\nSome may claim that it still falls short of capturing the opulence of the old palace, but even they cannot deny that it is once again a seat fit for a truly great [CHARACTER.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]."

Shadows twist and dance across the ancient walls as his figure manifests in the empty air, the darkness from behind the world seeping into Mundus around him.\n\nHe knows that I was the one who freed him and I may demand his service in return.\nYet, I can feel the weight of his malevolent gaze rest upon me, as he awaits my reaction to his apperance."

Lillmoth New City is finished!\n\nWhile it may not be as grand as originally envisioned and its longevity in this climate is uncertain, for now, the region can prosper.

Yet, its true magnificence remains elusive, for the heart of the relief—the singing crystal—is still missing.\n\nOr at least, so it seems. This morning, [thief.GetName] approaches me with exhilarating news. The singing crystal, thought lost to the annals of history, has been found. It currently resides in the possession of [crystal_holder.GetFullName]. With a glint of mischief in [thief.GetHerHis] eyes, [thief.GetNameNoTooltip] suggests an audacious plan: to emulate the legendary thief Rahjin, who once stole the singing crystal from the relief in the first place."
