[realm_priest.GetFirstName|U] informs me that they are gathering around a charismatic leader, claiming the plague is a sign of the Daedric Prince Peryite and a demonstration of his power. Instead of combating the illness, they seek to embrace it, with some even deliberately infecting themselves.\n\nSuch reckless behavior cannot be tolerated. [realm_priest.GetFirstName|U] is eager to guide these souls back to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], but it is uncertain how these fanatics will respond to his efforts.\n\nAlternatively, I could hire someone to just eliminate the leader of this movement..."

"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have very disturbing news. There are sightings of a flying... thing in [epidemic_county.GetNameNoTier]. It floats through the air as if filled with gas like a netch. Some say it is a vehicle of the Sload. Worse yet, it has been seen loading the corpses of those who perished in the epidemic.

 ek_epidemic_events.1002.desc: "As if the epidemic ravaging through [epidemic_county.GetNameNoTier] wasn't bad enough, now I receive news from [messenger.GetFirstName] about growing unrest among the local population. Apparently, they suspect the Seasload as the true origin of this disease and are now trembling in fear of what may come next. An invasion from the sea itself? Dark magic turning the deceased into undead thralls?\n\nI wonder what measures could be taken against such a threat. If it really is the work of the Sload, it may be possible to appease them... Or perhaps this should all be dismissed as the ramblings of fearful peasants?"

 ek_epidemic_events.1005.desc: "With the ongoing epidemic in my realm, it would be wise to take whatever measures possible to safeguard my capital against this threat. Fortunately, there are a few skilled alchemists and potion sellers who may be able to help in the battle against the disease. While their products may not fully cure those who have fallen ill, they can alleviate symptoms and sometimes aid the body enough to survive on its own.\n\nHowever, in these demanding times, it would require a significant stock of potions, which takes time to produce and requires a lot expensive ingredients."

After all, there are tales abound of miraculous healings granted to chosen individuals, especially favored by their deities. Have we been deemed unworthy of such divine favor, or have our supplications been uttered in vain?\n\nPerhaps it is time to offer another prayer, maybe even accompanied by a tribute of gold, to demonstrate that my devotion is not mere words but a testament of unwavering faith."

 ek_epidemic_events.1007.desc: "It is rare for my guards to permit uninvited guests directly into my court, but I understand why they made an exception for [restoration_mage.GetFirstName]. Evidently, [restoration_mage.GetSheHe] is well versed in restoration magic, able to heal wounds, treat diseases, and perform even more miraculous feats.\n\nWith the current epidemic ravaging my land, it would be unwise to refuse such aid. However, this [restoration_mage.GetFirstName] does not offer [restoration_mage.GetHerHis] services freely - [restoration_mage.GetSheHe] demands to be employed as my court mage, asserting that a steady salary would enable [restoration_mage.GetHerHis] full dedication to the craft."

 ek_epidemic_events.1008.desc: "As if the current epidemic weren't dire enough, it has spawned another urgent crisis: Necromancers.\nSeizing upon the abundance of fresh corpses, they have begun raising the dead as their puppets.\n\nThis not only amplifies their power and influence to a critical degree but also exacerbates the spread of infection, as these undead still carry the disease. Such vile acts cannot go unanswered, yet I cannot risk the further infection of more people by sending additional guards to [epidemic_county.GetNameNoTier]. Therefore, I have to find another solution to this problem."

Yet, nothing could have prepared me for the moment I became its target.\n\nAs I stand frozen in shock, [greenspore_victim.GetFirstName] charges at me, eyes blazing red and frothing from the mouth.

 ek_epidemic_events.1011.desc: "Few diseases in Tamriel are as widespread as Ataxia. Its notoriety and the wealth of knowledge surrounding it do not diminish its deadliness, but they do provide a vast array of information on its workings and treatments. Ataxia weakens the entire body, specifically targeting the bones, rendering them fragile and unable to bear the weight of the own body. The elderly are particularly susceptible to its ravages.\n\nWith this epidemic now reaching my capital [capital.GetNameNoTier], it is imperative to take swift and decisive action to protect the population as best as possible."

While some may experience nothing more than a severe fever, others endure bizarre and excruciating side effects, often leading to a gruesome death.\n\nAs a result, [mage.GetFirstName] appears ready to take desperate measures, attempting to stunt [mage.GetHerHis] magical abilities to safeguard against this relentless threat."

As I approach, I see sweat dripping from [knight.GetHerHis] face and [knight.GetHerHis] hand trembling, barely able to lift the sword.

People are dying in droves, and even those who recover are left weakened, requiring weeks or even months to regain their full strength.

 ek_epidemic_events.1015.desc: "The epidemic, sent by Peryite himself, is undeniably leaving its mark on my realm. While it may not be as lethal as other diseases, it spreads insidiously, taking root in the bodies of the infected for months or even years. Many of them face segregation as a consequence, shunned by their own communities, leading to groups of infected wandering the land.\n\nHowever, their nomadic existence seems to be nearing an end. [steward.GetFirstName|U] informs me that these groups are now uniting and preparing for an exodus to seek refuge in more hospitable lands. Such a mass exodus would result in a drastic population drain, thus demanding a decision by me."

Surely, the Prince of Plagues crafted this disease for a greater purpose - perhaps to cleanse the land of the weak and unworthy of his favor. But as a celebrated ruler, what more must I prove?\n\nPerhaps my fate is not to perish but to endure.
