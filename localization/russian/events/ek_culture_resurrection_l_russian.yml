  culture_resurrection_event.0001.desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, the Nords forced our people out of our homes.\n\nSince then, we have been forced to eke out our meagre existences in secret enclaves like my own in [GetPlayer.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], shielded by magic and remoteness so that nobody could ever do us harm again.\n\nThe magical barriers and cloaks have done their work well — but so too has hunger, and it has driven us out as no mortal has done since the Nords of old. Our people have grown too many and the soil too bleak to sustain ourselves much longer. It is time for me to lead my people back into the harsh world outside."

  culture_resurrection_event.0002.desc:0 "It is not natural for our people to live on the surface. The air and sounds are strange — to say nothing of the world of light which we have no way of hearing or touching.\n\nIt will be a challenge to settle above, surrounded by these seeing creatures which wish us nothing but harm. But we are not cowards.\n\nI shall lead us to the challenge and to the surface, and with us shall come our Chaurus and culture."
