 ek_dynasty_events.0001.desc:0 "As house head, I have decided that magic will be the cornerstone of our dynastic legacy. Tales of Tamriel's legendary schools of magic — Conjuration, Alteration, Illusion, Destruction, Restoration, and Necromancy — fill the halls of my court. Each school offers power and prestige, but also unique challenges. The time has come for me to choose the magical path that will define my house for generations. What kind of magical mastery shall we pursue?"
