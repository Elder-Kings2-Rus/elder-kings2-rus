 grand_ritual.1000.desc:0 "Death is inevitable, but does it have to be so soon?\n\nThe greatest mages seemingly manage to prolong their time among the living, in some cases centuries beyond their natural life. If they can do it so can I - even with just a few more years I could achieve so much!\n\nThe path I have chosen to walk is not without risks. There are many mages who only quickened their demise in the persuit of immortality."

 grand_ritual.1010.desc:0 "The way to Immortality is manifold. The most common form of immortality realises itself as simple mindless beings, roaming the land in a beastly rage or serving as thralls to all sorts of nefarious purposes.\n\nMore sophisticated means involve wizardry, complex usage of alchemical properties and even toying with divinity itself.\n\nThe only common point in all of them is the improbability of achieving this goal by oneself. I must seek assistance."
