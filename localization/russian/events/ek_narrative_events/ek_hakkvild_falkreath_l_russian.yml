  ek_hakkvild.0001.desc:0 "Six years ago the horde of [yashnag.GetFirstName] descended upon the Hold of Falkreath and slew my brother [falk.GetFirstNameRegnal], the rightful Jarl of [falkreath.GetBaseNameNoTier]. Just days later the orc army stood at the gates of the capital, forcing the son of [falk.GetFirstName] and new Jarl, [hakkvild.GetName] to flee to my court. \n\nHakkvild has been working on a plan to reconquer Falkreath from those vile savages ever since - and today he approached me, saying that soon he'll be ready to reveal it to me."
