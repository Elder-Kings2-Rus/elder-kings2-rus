reclaim_eplear_heritage_decision_desc:0 "Millennia ago, King Eplear Camoran united the disparate Bosmer tribes into the High Kingdom of Valenwood. Of such glory were his deeds that even the distant Nords had to acknowledge it as the beginning of a new Era. That glory and unity in now lost, but Valenwood still remembers who its true rulers are, and House [ROOT.House.GetName] shall stake its claim as the true heirs of King Eplear."

camoran_decision_event.0001.desc:0 "As I sit on the throne of a fully united Valenwood as a trueborn heir of King Eplear, it becomes increasingly apparent that my House is the most worthy of being considered the inheritors of the Camoran name. While the other branches continue to be referred to by names consisting of their place of rule, ours is increasingly just called House Camoran like it was in the old days.\n\nThe people of Valenwood now see me as a restorer of the old order, where Valenwood stood as one under a Camoran monarch, and I can only hope that neither Valenwood nor House Camoran ever falls again."

camoran_decision_event.0002.desc:0 "[founder.GetTitledFirstName] has superseded the claim of [ROOT.House.GetName] as the true heirs of King Eplear, and is now recognised as a true Camoran High King of Valenwood.\n\nMany celebrate this act as a return to normalcy for our Province, but my House and I have had their realities shattered as we are now indisputably considered a mere offshoot of the great House Camoran that rules Valenwood."
