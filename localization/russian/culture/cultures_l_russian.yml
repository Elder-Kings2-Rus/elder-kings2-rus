    malapiit_desc:0 "The Khajiit have their own name for the Niben -- Malapi -- and the Malapiit have roamed its fertile banks since times immemorial. But history wasn't kind to them, always pitting them against those who wish to drive them off: first the Ayleids, now the Cyrodiilics, and sometimes even other Khajiit. The Malapiit, however, remain calm under this perpetual siege; the borders may change a thousand times over, but they will be there always, dipping fishing rods into the great Malapi.\n\nMalapiit have largely neglected Elsweyr's cultural pull through the ages and maintained their vibrant customs, predating the fall of the Sixteen Kingdoms, and perhaps even the Sixteen Kingdoms themselves."
