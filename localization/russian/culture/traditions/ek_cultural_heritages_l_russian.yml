 heritage_ayleid_name:0 "Ayleid"
 heritage_ayleid_collective_noun:0 "Ayleids"
 heritage_ayleid_desc:0 "The "Heartland High Elves", self-styled as Saliache and usually referred to as Ayleids ressemble Altmer but have carved their own path in Tamrielic history. During the Merethic Era they ruled over fertile Cyrodiil, enslaving the human Nedes and imprinting upon them varying amounts of their own culture. In the late Merethic and early First Era, religious civil war tore them apart. The conflict reached its climax in 1E 198 at the "Scouring of Wendelbek", leading to the exile of the aedraphile "Barsaebic" to Black Marsh. \n\nJust fifty years after this event, the nedic slaves began an uprising against their cruel masters. The Alessian Slave Rebellion ended with most Ayleid dead or exiled from Cyrodiil to Valenwood or High Rock, their hegemony shattered. \nAyleids in the Second Era are only a shadow of their former selves, barely clinging on to their last holdings."

 heritage_dwemeri_name:0 "Dwemeri"
 heritage_dwemeri_collective_noun:0 "Dwemer"
 heritage_dwemeri_desc:0 "The Dwemer were reclusive subterranean Mer found all over Northern Tamriel, from the sands of Hammerfell to the ashlands of Morrowind.\n\nNo god was worthy of adoration in their eyes, the numinous cravings of other intelligent peoples being very strange to the Deep Folk. They would rather uncover the Aurbis' secrets and the path to a higher state of existence. The effortless use of Elder Scrolls demonstrates their knowledge of key secrets.\n\nThe Dwemer freehold relied on their signature metal—golden and stainless—and Animunculi, constructs powered by steam and soul magic for war and labor. Usually, settlements were independent and self-sustaining but there are records of great Dwemer kingdoms in Volenfell and Vvardenfell.\n\nThe Dwemer completely vanished after the Battle of Red Mountain in 1E 700"

 heritage_bosmeri_name:0 "Bosmeri"
 heritage_bosmeri_collective_noun:0 "Bosmer"
 heritage_bosmeri_desc:0 "The Bosmer are a race of Elven clan-folk of Valenwood, a forested province in southwestern Tamriel. In the Dawn Era, Y'ffre shaped them out of the primordial Ooze in exchange for abiding by the Green Pact, a prescription that forbids harming any plant life within Valenwood and advocates a strictly carnivorous diet. Typical Bosmer are short, tanned Mer and may sport horns, flat pupils or eerie pitch black eyes. These expert bowmen coalesce in tight-knit clans, hardened by the trials of nature and internecine warfare.\n\nThe Merethic Era came to an end when Eplear Camoran united the Province under a single rule, a feat which can be considered the zenith of Bosmer history. Valenwood was eventually conquered by the Reman Empire in the Late First Era, causing some to forsake tradition in favour of Altmer or Cyrodilic customs. Albeit weakened, the Camoran clansfolk still ruled vast swathes of land well into the Second Era, squabbling to reclaim the mantle of Hart-King during the Interregnum."

 heritage_chimeri_name:0 "Chimeri"
 heritage_chimeri_collective_noun:0 "Chimer"
 heritage_chimeri_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago during the Merethic Era, a Mer named Veloth received a vision bidding him to go east along with all who would listen. Soon he gathered other dissidents from Summerset Isles, all eager to shun the mainstream Aedric pantheon of the Altmer and freely worship Daedra.\n\nDuring this Exodus, the Velothi overcame many ordeals and proved their faith: even a God-King failed to prevent their migration! At last they reached their destination, the lands of Resdayn. Gradually they were taught prophecy, betrayal and intrigue by their patron gods, whom they dubbed the 'Good Daedra': Azura, Boëthiäh, and Mephala. Under their guidance, they established a thriving civilization despite ruinous infighting and competitition with godless Dwemer and warlike Men for resources.\n\nThey became the Chimer, the Northern Folk."

 heritage_dunmeri_name:0 "Dunmeri"

 heritage_dunmeri_desc:0 "The ash-skinned, red-eyed Dunmer hail from Morrowind, a grim land in the northwest of Tamriel. Their ancestors, -the $chimer_collective_noun$- were cursed following the Battle of Red Mountain. Since then, most of the Dunmer have lived under the Great House Council, overseen by the Tribunal Temple. Yet, the Ashlanders cling to the old Velothi pantheon and denounce the Almsivi as false gods and betrayers.\n\nDuring the Second Era, Morrowind is turned inwards and hasn't felt the collapse of the Potentate as strongly as others. The Great Houses stay strong with the backing of the Living Gods but their designs are mysterious and minor houses could upset the status quo if they ride the winds of change."

 heritage_tsaesci_desc:0 "The Tsaesci trace their bloodline back to an ancient tribe of Men that crossed the Padomaic Ocean, and now calls the lush, emerald valleys of Akavir their home. The core trait of all Tsaesci cultures is their adherence to the art and philosophy of Tsaescence. A macabre, yet elegant practice, which is often villified by those who don't understand it."

They are hardy and resilient people, and are held among the most respected warriors and soldiers in all of Tamriel. The Nords see themselves as eternal outsiders and invaders, and even when they conquer and rule another people, they rarely feel kinship with them."

 heritage_breton_collective_noun:0 "Bretons"
 heritage_breton_desc:0 "No Men have felt the imprint of Elves on their culture more than the Bretons. Their name may come from the beratu (“half blood”) of the Direnni Hegemony but most Bretons have little Mer blood now. After the Battle of Glenumbra Moors they threw off the Direnni yoke to pursue their own ambitions. \n\nWith “every hill, a castle. Every castle, a kingdom”, Breton princes are fiercely independent and competitive, making use of any means necessary in their bid for power. They take pride in arcane knowledge and adherence to chivalric virtues."

 heritage_lilmothiit_desc:0 "The crafty founders of Blackrose and Lilmoth, the Lilmothiit are said to be distant cousins of the Khajiit and, perplexingly, the Bosmer. Once found all over Black Marsh, a series of catastrophes throughout history left but a remnant population on the edge of Murkwood. They lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle where migratory kinship groups and compact meritocratic cities coexist in delicate cooperation. A curious detail of Lilmothiit physiology is their apparent lack of gender dimorphism which is emphasized in their Lorkhanic myths."

 heritage_cyrodiilic_name:0 "Cyrodiilic"

 heritage_cyrodiilic_desc:0 "Native to the heartlands of Tamriel, the Cyrodiilics, also known as "Imperials", have dominated the continent's political and cultural arena ever since the fall of the Ayleid Empire, toppled by Saint Alessia, the Slave-Queen. Their traditional central position has left the Cyrodiilics open to the influences of most of the realms that neighbour Cyrodiil, especially from the Nords and Bretons. \n\nCyrodiilics take pride in their civilised manners and general competence in all pursuits, whether military, scholarly or administrative. Much of Tamriel's literature is produced by Imperial scholars (with some clear biases at times) which is a testament to their far ranging networks and advanced scholarly infrastructure. \nThe vastness of Cyrodiil has given origin to many local subcultures, of which the most known are the Colovians of the west and the Nibenese of the east."

 heritage_goblinken_desc:0 "Small and hunchbacked, the stunted look of the Goblin-Ken doesn't help alleviate their meagre existences.

But some time during the First Era, the Xanmeer civilization collapsed following the mysterious 'Duskfall'. The Hist trees foresaw the disaster and sheltered Saxhleel tribes ensuring the steady rise of Hist worship and a simpler subsistence lifestyle in most communities.\n\nThe trees maintain a symbiotic relationship with their caretaker tribe: Tree-Minders ensure daily care of the Hist tree, whilst Hist trees enable eggs to hatch and newborns to consume its Sap, assuming humanoid form."
