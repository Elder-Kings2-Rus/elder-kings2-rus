 language_tamrielic_name:0 "Tamrielic"
 
 language_altmeris_name:0 "Altmeris"
 language_altmeris_desc:0 "The proud Altmer and have a long history with their language, with it bequeathing both script and lexicon to “Tamrielic”. The Altmer are notorious grammar disciplinarians, teachers taking great care to drill into their students proper grammar, elocution and syntax. It is considered shameful to not be able to recite classics of Altmeri literature in the sanctioned way."
 
 language_falmeris_name:0 "Falmeris"
 
 language_atmoran_name:0 "Atmoran"
 language_atmoran_desc:0 "Men native to Atmora spoke their own language prior to the colononization of Tamriel and the Dragon Wars. Nordic is different but ultimately descended from old Atmoran"
 
 language_ayleidoon_name:0 "Ayleidoon"
 language_ayleidoon_desc:0 "The Ayleids of old have long since fallen, but their language is well attested, and extant in their surviving communities. It had a strong influence on Cyrodilic and thus Tamriel's languages as a whole. Ayleidoon is close to Altmeris but has somewhat exotic features like using the suffix -che instead of -mer to refer to the Elven peoples."
 
 language_bosmeris_name:0 "Bosmeris"
 language_bosmeris_desc:0 "The Bosmeri vernacular originated in Valenwood, amongst the followers of the Green Pact. Many warring tribes and cities are nestled within the jungles but along with Bosmeris, the religious guidance of the Silvenar and the enduring political legacy of the Camoran clan form the cornerstones of their shared identity."
 
 language_bretic_name:0 "Bretic"
 language_bretic_desc:0 "Bretic is spoken all across High Rock. It has Nedic roots but the long years of the Hegemony imprinted a noticeable Altmeris superstratum on it. It includes the speakers' very own name, Breton coming from beratu - “half” -, the mixed-blood lower bureaucrats that kept the Hegemony's day-to-day operations running."
 
 language_chimeris_name:0 "Ald Chimeris"
 language_chimeris_desc:0 "Ald Chimeris was originally a specific dialect of Altmeris, but it gained status during the Velothi Exodus and went on to found its own language family. Chimeris is the closest one can get to the language of Veloth and the people he led during the Exodus. Chimeris is spoken by those left untouched by Azura's wrath at the Battle of Red Mountain."
 
 language_cyrodiilic_name:0 "Cyrodiilic"
 language_cyrodiilic_desc:0 "Cyrodilic is spoken in the Heart of Tamriel but also everywhere where Imperial influence once extended. As a mother tongue, however, it is only in Cyrodiil proper and some heavily imperialized cultures that you will find it. Ayleidoon and Nordic amongst others have all bestowed something upon this Nedic language, a testament to the Cyrodiils history of cultural exchange."
 
 language_daedric_name:0 "Daedric"
 
 language_dunmeris_name:0 "Dunmeris"
 language_dunmeris_desc:0 "High Velothi culture underwent a period of decline with urban settlement receding and the Chimer devolving into all out tribalism. The War of the First Council united them once more and following the Battle of Red Mountain, the Tribunal kept what was now the Dunmer together. This fostered a dialect continuum that has an acrolect for diplomacy, education, literature and trade, the so-called Dunmeris."
 
 language_duraki_name:0 "Duraki"
 language_duraki_desc:0 "The Duraki language was once spoken throughout most of the Deathlands, and even though the Duraki's many enemies characterized them as a savage and warlike people, most surviving texts are sophisticated heroic tales and astrological treatises, which both reveal a complex grammar and a great dedication to nuance in describing the stars and human virtues."
 
 language_dwemeris_name:0 "Dwemeris"
 language_dwemeris_desc:0 "The Deep Folk were highly literate and carved at length in their enigmatic tongue. It is said that proficient speakers can stir Tonal Magic"
 
 language_galen_name:0 "Galen"
 language_galen_desc:0 "The native language of the Men-of-Galen appears to be related to old Bretic, but has minimal Elven influence and as a consequence bears a superficial resemblence to Reachtongue. The Galen people used to write this language exclusively with a repertoire of Druidic ideograms, but under Systrean influence have slowly adopted the Tamrielic alphabet."
 
 language_gemha_name:0 "Gemha"
 language_gemha_desc:0 "The Gemha spoke a melodic, florid language related to that of the Men-of-Ge, but somewhat more intelligible to Cyrodiilic speakers. Gemha is still found in some placenames in eastern Nibenay, though even the locals tend to be unaware of this connection."
 
 language_goblin_name:0 "Goblinspeak"
 language_goblin_desc:0 "The Goblins' language is an isolate, descending neither from the Merish language of the Dawn Era nor the earliest Mannish languages. Because it is so different in such fundamental ways, the people of Tamriel have propagated the misconception that Goblins communicate in gibberish and overall convey no more than simple ideas. However, those who take the time to learn the Goblin-ken's language find that it is different, but by no means inferior or even more simple than other languages on Nirn."
 
 language_horsemen_name:0 "Horsemen"
 language_horsemen_desc:0 "The Horsemen speak a creole of Breton and Yoku"
 
 language_iron_orcish_name:0 "Iron Orcish"
 language_iron_orcish_desc:0 "The Iron Orcs have their own manner of Orcish, incomprehensible to those versed in stronghold Orcish. Along with their curious religion (for Orcs that is) it further sets apart this unique and mysterious culture. Speculation abounds on this dissimilarity in both speech and religion."
 
 language_keptu_name:0 "Keptu"
 language_keptu_desc:0 "The Ket-Keptu language is curt and simple, but spoken phrases can cascade to considerable length due to its long (and often untranslatable) compound words. The Redguards claim that the Keptu language knows more than a hundred words for stone, but this anecdote is not usually taken seriously."
 
 language_kothri_name:0 "Kothri"
 language_kothri_desc:0 "Least conservative among all the Nedic languages in Black Marsh, Kothri has borrowed much from its neighbours, including Cyrod verbs, Dunmeri onomastics and phonemes native to Jel. Despite this generous borrowing, the Kothri tongue remains recognisable as a Mannish language, and preserves ancient Nedic roots."
 
 language_kreathish_name:0 "Kreathtongue"
 language_kreathish_desc:0 "The Men-of-Kreath spoke a language that has much in common with Reachtongue, but also archaic Nordic as passed down in the skaldic tradition. To some, this proves that the Atmorans were once Nedes before they departed towards the northern continent, while others assume that Kreathtongue preserved early Atmoran influence better than other local dialects."
 
 language_jaegi_name:0 "Jaegi"
 language_jaegi_desc:0 "The Jaegi speak the ancestral language that the Tsaesci rejected. It could, in theory, be traced to its hypothetical ancestors back on Tamriel, but such an endeavor would surely kill a corpus of scholars."
 
 language_jel_name:0 "Jel"
 language_jel_name_desc:0 "Jel, the language spoken by the Saxhleel, defies classification and to many outsiders, comprehension. It is defined as much by what can be expressed in it as by that which is impossible to express, such as the fundamental concept of time, or things odious to the Argonians' ethics. Spoken Jel is usually embellished and modulated through body language, and can convey concepts so specific yet indistinct that translation into other languages is outright impossible."

 language_lilmothiit_name:0 "Lilmothiit"
 language_lilmothiit_desc:0 "Unique among languages in Tamriel, the Lilmothiit tongue makes no distinction between the sexes, but instead employs a number of other registers in its spoken form to address others according to their relative status, age, current location relative to their prowl, travelling experience, and so on. Most outsiders attempting to learn it have a hard time adjusting to this, and tend to use simple "standard" Lilmothiit that makes them sound boorish and a little naive, which some Lilmothiit, at least, find endearing."
 
 language_nedic_name:0 "Nedic"
 language_nedic_desc:0 "The ancient Nedes spoke innumerable dialects, some of which are close to languages spoken to this day while others are so different as to boggle the mind and complicate attempts at categorization. The prevalent belief is that the Nedic languages descend from the primordial Ehlnofex of the et'Ada, and that though the various Nedic dialects share a common ancestry with the Elven languages, they developed in metaphysical opposition to them."
 
 language_nordic_name:0 "Nordic"
 language_nordic_desc:0 "Nordic is spoken all across Skyrim and in many communities with Nord roots. It descends from Atmoran but has seen intensifying Cyrodilic influence due to both foreign trade and education, and the effective hegemony of the Second Empire over the Nords in the last centuries. Draconic also influenced it during the heyday of the Dragon Cult."

 language_old_bretic_name:0 "Old Bretic"
 
 language_old_cyrod_name:0 "Old Cyrod"
 language_old_cyrod_desc:0 "The most pristine of the Nedic tongues in Cyrodiil, the isolated and marginal communities of Old Cyrodilic speakers have been left on the periphery of Ayleid then Imperial civilization. This enabled them to keep a speech relatively free of outside influence."
 
 language_orma_name:0 "Orma"
 language_orma_desc:0 "Orma has been mistaken as a primitive stage in the Cyrodiilic language, but this understanding is merely skin-deep; while it does have much in common with the languages of Cyrod, the Orma language is tonal, and contains close to a dozen vowel tones, the subtle distinctions to which can add hints of irony, innuendo, and even contradicton to otherwise perfect homophones." 
 
 language_horwalli_name:0 "Horwalli"
 language_horwalli_desc:0 "The Horwalli language has long puzzled scholars, who have attempted to connect it to ancient riverine dialects of Nibenese, to the Keptulet tongue, and even to a sacred language once spoken by the Rontha ruling class. It remains alien even in the alien Black Marsh, but its rules and sounds correspond to those of a Nedic language."
 
 language_orcish_name:0 "Orcish"
 language_orcish_desc:0 "Orcish is perhaps the most misunderstood and scorned idiom in Tamriel. It is a specialist skill to know the tongue of the Orsimer due to prejudice (some likened it to “learning Centaurian or Giantish”) and their distrust. Thankfully, stronghold exiles with didactic leanings have contributed to disseminating the language and - hopefully - furthering the acceptance of their kin in Tamriel."
 
 language_perena_name:0 "Perena"
 language_perena_desc:0 "Scholars have found it troublesome to reconstruct the Perena language, not only due to the scarceness of its sources: the Perena ruling class placed great importance on the acquisition of foreign language, Nedic and otherwise, and Perena inscriptions resemble a linguistic patchwork."
 
 language_quey_name:0 "Quey"
 language_quey_desc:0 "Lying halfway between Tamriel and Akavir, the thalassocratic Chimer of Cathnoquey understandably have their own vernacular. Just like its speakers went further away in their Exodus, Quey has strayed further yet from Aldmeris than either Chimeris or Dunmeris back in Dawn's Beauty."
 
 language_reachtongue_name:0 "Reachtongue"
 language_reachtongue_desc:0 "The fractious Reachfolk have their own parlances, despite constant warring, alliances, trade and intermarriage. Although there isn't any official standard, the Witchfolk are shrewd, and have grasped how to overcome dialectal differences on the fly. Generations of envoys have tacitly created a standard variant of Reachtongue."
 
 language_rontha_name:0 "Rontha"
 language_rontha_desc:0 "The Rontha language has a reputation for being chaotic, full of exceptions and irregularities, and appearing more like three languages pretending to be one than an organic whole. Despite this, the old Stonefalls Nedic language holds the eccentric honour of being the sole human tongue to have influenced Chimeris, accounting for the non-Daedric substrate that distinguishes it from the language of Summerset, mostly through martial loanwords."
 
 language_riektongue_name:0 "Riektongue"
 language_riektongue_desc:0 "Riektongue is the single other language on Tamriel related to that of the Goblins, though divergence a long time ago and the isolation of the Rieklings and Riekrs has made it so distinct as to make it unintelligible to other Goblins. Speakers of other languages find it just as unintelligible, in general."
 
 language_skaal_name:0 "Skaal"
 language_skaal_desc:0 "The insular Skaal have their own branch of Atmoran language known as Skaal or “Skaal Nordic”. Their isolation has left their tongue free of much continental influence and it is more conservative than Nordic, much like their religion."
 
 language_taagra_name:0 "Ta'agra"
 language_taagra_desc:0 "Khajiit means “sandwalker” in Ta'agra, a clear reference to the many dunes of Elsweyr. Ta'agra supposedly has no word for rules calling them “foolish concepts”. Still, the Khajiit have formed prosperous kingdoms, have a rich religious canon and established an Empire that stretched into Valenwood up to Arenthia. This means they are no strangers to law and organization."
 
 language_tsaesci_name:0 "Tsaesci"
 language_tsaesci_desc:0 "The defining feature of Tsaesci is its artificiality. All other languages emerged naturally, but Tsaesci has been created, and such deliberation can be noticed throughout its grammar and vocabulary. It is often described as a cross between poetry and mathematics, and an acquired fluency is always a source of prestige and personal pride. One of the most fascinating things about Tsaesci is total lack of influences, or even ancestry, from other languages; its linguistic sterility is kept via thorough, regular reforms."
 
 language_velothis_name:0 "Velothis"
 language_velothis_desc:0 "Following the ascension of the Tribunal, the nascent Low Velothi culture was split along sectarian lines that solidified into an ethnic divide. The hostile and hardened Velothi people kept the name and religion of their forefathers as they developed their culture. The Ashlanders and House Dunmer do not share the same language anymore."

 language_yespest_name:0 "Yespest"
 language_yespest_desc:0 "The Yespest speak a Nedic language that bears some tenuous resemblance to ancient Cyrodiilic, but which seems to at once preserve archaic forms that Cyrodiilic has simplified under elven influence, and yet revel in Ayleidoon loanwords and affectations. This seeming contradiction has made it difficult to learn for both human and elven outsiders."
 
 language_yoku_name:0 "Classical Yoku"
 language_yoku_desc:0 "'Classical Yoku' is a bit of a misnomer, Yoku having obviously evolved since the First Era. From the standpoint of the Redguards it is much closer to the ancient epics. It is common practice among the affluent—moreso Crowns— to have their heirs learn it. "
 language_tamrielic_yoku_name:0 "Tamrielic Yoku"
 language_tamrielic_yoku_desc:0 "The Yoku spoken in Hammerfell can be qualified as 'Tamrielic'. It has substantial influence from Cyrodilic as one can guess but also from Altmer and even Nedic sources but ultimately Yokudan in character. Forebears tend to fully embrace it whilst Crowns make a point of learning Classical Yoku #italic 'to keep the old ways alive'#!."
 
 language_dovahzul_name:0 "Dovahzul"
 
 #language_maormeris_name:0 "Aldmeris"
 language_maormeris_name:0 "Maormeris"
 language_maormeris_desc:0 "The Aldmeris dialect of the Maormer, colloquially called Pyandoneaic at times. The tongue of the southern reavers is seldom known in Tamriel due to limited interaction"
