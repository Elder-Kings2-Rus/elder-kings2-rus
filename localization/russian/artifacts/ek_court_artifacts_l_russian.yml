The Moonlight Blade is considered a sacred tool for the duty of guiding, protecting and redeeming the souls of their People. While on its own the blade is a deadly weapon against the Dro-m'Athra, in the hands of those who know the Order's secrets, the Moonlight Blade can cut through liminal barriers, both the mundane and those between worlds. In particular, the ushering souls to their fated afterlife, this power comes from the second nature of the Moonlight Blade, as it functions as a gateway to the Crossing, a transitional realm between Nirn and Sands Behind the Stars. Within the Order of the Hidden Moon, a guardian was selected to wield the Moonlight Blade from the adepts, this position required someone with an iron will and conviction. The Blade was passed from guardian to guardian without incident until sometime in the First Era, when the warrior Shando-ri became its wielder. His friend and rival, Arum-Khal, had slowly become dissatisfied with the Order's actions and Shando-ri being chosen over him was the last straw. Arum-Khal renounced Azurah and the Order, with many adepts following him, leading to a bloody civil war within the temple. At the end of these battles, the now-lich Arum-Khal had become far too powerful for the survivors to end him permanently and he was instead sealed within the crypts. In preparation for the Dro-m'Athra Lich's return, Shando-ri underwent a six month ritual to transfer his soul and spirit to the Moonlight Blade, to remain on Nirn until he could slay the Dark Adept. Many of the surviving adepts sacrificed themselves to further empower the Moonlight Blade, though none were left to wield it in the end." #PLACEHOLDER
