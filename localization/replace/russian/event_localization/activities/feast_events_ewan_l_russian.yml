 feast_events_ewan.0001.desc.water:0 "wanders along the edge of [activity.GetHost.Custom('IndefiniteBodyOfWater')] close to the walls. My blackjack clutched in [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')], I just need to hit [intent_target.GetHerHim] hard enough that [intent_target.GetSheHe]'s stunned — the water will take care of the rest, and it'll even look like an accident."
 feast_events_ewan.0001.desc.critter:1 "traipses the paths of the courtyard. Clutched in my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] (hopefully well-restrained) is a venomous [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')]. Fierce, deadly, I only need to throw it at a bare patch of [intent_target.Custom('SkinScalesFur')] to let it do its wicked work."
