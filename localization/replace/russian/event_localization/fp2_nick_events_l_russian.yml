 fp2_yearly.4003.desc:0 "The holy city of Satakalaam is a magnet for the faithful, drawing pilgrims from lands local and distant. The route to it is accordingly well-travelled, wending its way to the site from the coast of Sentinel. Of course, where people rich enough to travel to the holy site exist, so too do those looking to profit from their trust in Tu'whacca.\n\nIt is the fifth report of a violent robbery by bandits in as many days on the stretches of land that run through my territory that finally drives my [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetFirstName] to consult with me on how to deal with this issue."
