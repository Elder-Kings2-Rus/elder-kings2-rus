 travel_events.2105.desc_negative:0 "I watch in astonishment as my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('GetRivalNemesis', SCOPE.sC('visiting_ruler'))] slashes through assassins left and right, the rest of them running off in terror. [visiting_ruler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] circles back, then stops right in front of me: "Looks like you could use the help," [visiting_ruler.GetSheHe] grunts.\n\nI hesitate. While [visiting_ruler.GetSheHe] #EMP did#! just save my [ROOT.Char.Custom('SkinScalesFur')], how could I possibly trust [visiting_ruler.GetHerHim]... ? I reluctantly nod."
 travel_events.2015.desc:0 "[quarry_guide.GetTitledFirstName|U] is jittery with childish glee as [quarry_guide.GetSheHe] guides my visit to the peat quarry in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. For some incomprehensible reason, [quarry_guide.GetSheHe] seems to think this place is the jewel in [quarry_guide.GetHerHis] grassy crown.\n\nI look out over the ravaged field, all brown and grayish green.\nMy eyelids grow heavy. Lately, sleep has been eluding me. Slowly they slide shut...\n\nSuddenly I jolt awake, [quarry_guide.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] [quarry_guide.Custom('HandClawPaw')] at my sleeve.\n"... was I #EMP boring#! you?""
 travel_events.2022.desc_pack:0 "As we walk through an arch into the next room, a large shape suddenly comes swinging down at us. The entire group jumps and yelps.\n\nAs I look up, the dark figure appears to be a skeleton, wrapped in a dark sheet. I frown as [estate_character.GetTitledFirstName|U] laughs and grins at us.\n\n"You should have seen the look on y'all's faces, m'lord and ladies!" My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('entourage_member_one'))], [entourage_member_one.GetTitledFirstName], is visibly agitated and approaches [estate_character.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] with a raised [entourage_member_one.Custom('HandClawPaw')]."
 travel_events.2030.desc:0 "In the morning, [entourage_chaplain.GetTitledFirstName] comes up to me, wringing [entourage_chaplain.GetHerHis] [entourage_chaplain.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')]. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] and [entourage_chaplain.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char)], I have the most horrid confession to make."\n\n[entourage_chaplain.GetSheHe|U] sighs heavily. "While I don't embrace any... decidedly insane... teachings like that [crop_circler.Custom('GetLassLad')] from last night, I have had... #EMP doubts.#!" [entourage_chaplain.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks at me closely, searching for sympathy with [entourage_chaplain.GetHerHis] predicament.\n\n"I am simply not sure [entourage_chaplain.GetFaith.HighGodName] truly exists and watches over us." [entourage_chaplain.GetSheHe|U] finishes, with a dramatic pause."
 travel_events.2033.desc_manhunt_first:0 "Long have I wanted to try my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] at nature's most elusive and dangerous prey. A smile plays at the corner of my [ROOT.Char.Custom('MouthSnoutBeak')]."
 travel_events.2039.desc_child_won:1 "[entourage_character.GetTitledFirstName] scrambles after the rabbit, bow readied, oblivious to the feeble bluff of my poorly loosed arrows.\n\nAfter some tussle with the undergrowth, [entourage_character.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] chirps triumphantly and darts forward, picking up the carcass of the pristine animal with an arrow firmly lodged in its tiny torso. I clap my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')] as [entourage_character.GetSheHe] beams at me."
 travel_events.2104.desc:0 "Me and my entourage ride head-first into the would-be assassins, blindsiding them completely. How incompetent do you have to be to not to have a clear view of your rear?\n\nWe easily slice through the few that resist, and the rest run off into the wilds. I look up to see [murder_target.GetTitledFirstName] staring at me, eyes wide and [murder_target.Custom('MouthSnoutBeak')] slightly agape.\n\nAs [murder_target.GetSheHe] snaps out of it, [murder_target.GetHerHis] facial features adjust, but [murder_target.GetSheHe] still seem surprised and grateful of my intervention. [murder_target.GetSheHe|U] beckons for me to come over."
 travel_events.2111.desc_died:0 "As the sun colors the sky red when it perishes down the horizon, the battle in front of me colors the ground red. I observe eagerly, trying to make out what side has the upper [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')].\n\nMy quandary is soon clarified as one particularly large and bulky rider roars victoriously, raising [rider.GetHerHis] arms in a skyward motion. One [rider.Custom('HandClawPaw')] is holding a blade, the other... the head of [travelling_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]."
