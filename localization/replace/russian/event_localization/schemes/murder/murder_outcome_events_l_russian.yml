 murder_outcome.2202.desc:0 "The deed is done. [target.GetTitledFirstName] will never grow up, or understand the world around [target.GetHerHim]. It was apparently simple, a sharp iron needle against the ear, easily piercing soft [target.Custom('SkinScalesFur')] and cartilage."
 murder_outcome.4203.opening:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] is still alive! It seems as if the [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreatureType')]-venom wasn't strong enough, and only caused a mild rash to spread across the infant's [target.Custom('SkinScalesFur')].\n\n"
 murder_outcome.4204.desc_opening:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] still lives! [target.GetSheHe|U] picked up the [target.Custom('FavoriteTreat')], but before [target.GetSheHe] could bite into it a street dog snatched it from [target.GetHerHis] [target.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')] and took off down the street.\n\n"

I fall to the ground as the bitten [ROOT.Char.Custom('FavoriteTreat')] slips from my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')]."
 murder_outcome.5001.poisoned_drink:0 "It doesn't take long before I am #EMP clawing#! at my neck trying to breath, to scream, to get any air at all past my swollen and bleeding throat. As my consciousness fades I see that there's blood and [ROOT.Char.Custom('SkinScalesFur')] under my nails; I'm going to have to wash that off, how unseemly..."
 murder_outcome.5002.poisoned_drink:0 "While having dinner a servant bursts into the room and slaps the goblet from my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] #EMP just#! as I am about to take a sip!\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], it's poison! One of the scullery maids... Forgive her, she took a sip, and she– she's dead!""

No one is close, and no one would notice if I snuck a bite...\n\nJust as I am about to bite into the treat a mangy street dog snatches it right out of my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')], swallows it whole, and promptly collapses dead to the ground."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0074.desc: "I am enjoying dinner on an evening like any other. A delightful goblet filled to the brim sits in front of me, tantalizing. As I finally reach for it, a whole host of servants bursts into the room screaming. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], stop! It's poisoned! One of us drank from the same barrel and promptly fell dead!" My [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] freezes in mid-air."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4021.desc: "People are weird. It is hard to find one willing to raise a [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] against an infant, but to place a [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')] in a cradle is, apparently, much more acceptable. The [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreatureType')], on its side, had no particular qualms either and struck true. The poison played its part quickly and mercilessly."
