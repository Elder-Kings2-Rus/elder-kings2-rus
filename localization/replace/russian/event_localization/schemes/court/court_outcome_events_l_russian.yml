 court_outcome.1102.end.desc:0 ""What are you doing here?!" [target.GetSheHe] asks, [target.GetHerHis] voice trembling. I raise my [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')], a gesture of peace, but [target.GetSheHe] draws [target.GetHerHis] dagger. "Do not come any closer! Leave at once, or I #EMP will#! hurt you!""
 court_outcome.1105.owner_fights.desc:0 "I scramble out of bed and run for the door, but the intruder is faster. [owner.GetSheHe|U] grabs my arm, tugs, and I fall. Before I can scream, a [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandClawPaw')] is covering my [ROOT.Char.Custom('MouthSnoutBeak')].\n\n"Listen closely, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. If you do what I say, no one will get—" [owner.GetHerHis|U] words turn into a gurgle as a dagger plunges deep into [owner.GetHerHis] neck.\n\n"[target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], are you alright?"

The intruder grabs my arm, tugs, and I spin around — sinking the blade deep into [owner.GetHerHis] stomach. [owner.GetSheHe|U] looks at me for an endlessly long moment, [owner.GetHerHis] lips moving without a sound. Then [owner.GetSheHe] falls to the ground.\n\n"[target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], are you alright?" By the window stands none other than [owner.GetTitledFirstName], blade in [owner.Custom('HandClawPaw')], ready to defend me. I throw myself into [owner.GetHerHis] arms and [owner.GetSheHe] holds me tight."
