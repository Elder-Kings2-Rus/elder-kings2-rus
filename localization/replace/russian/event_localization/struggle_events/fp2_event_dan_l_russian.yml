 fp2_yearly.1004.desc:0 "I am reading a history of the Hattu Metropoles Brigade — also known as "The Hawks of Hattu" due to their reverence for the hawk goddess Tava.\n\nLearning about the Second Yokudan Warrior Wave and their role in it is incredibly inspiring, from their involvement in the War of the Singers, to their leader [hawk_of_quraysh.GetFirstName] establishing the [hawk_dynasty.GetName] dynasty in Hammerfell, I can't help but think I should take some of it to heart."
 fp2_yearly.1004.a:0 "I too could inspire my men as they did at $c_ancestor_landing$."
 fp2_yearly.1004.b:0 "Their leader's diplomatic dealings with the [keptu.GetName] remnants are legendary."

 fp2_yearly.1005.desc:0 "Struggling and shouting, a large [hidden_viking.GetWomanMan] is dragged before me. [hidden_viking.GetSheHe|U] is clearly an orc raider, the type who has sown chaos in our realm for decades.\n\n"Please have mercy. My name is [hidden_viking.GetName] and I've been living in [viking_county.GetNameNoTooltip] for years. I was left behind because I was injured. The villagers saved me; they're my family now."\n\nThe $mountain_orc$ falls to [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] knees, hoping I'll spare [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] life. Several peasants confirm [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] story."


 fp2_yearly.1006.t:0 "Mammoth Cheese?"
 fp2_yearly.1006.desc:0 "I stop at a roadside stall selling some simple foods. The trader, [cheese_trader.GetName], plies me with different wares before reaching below the stall and bringing out a carved wooden box.\n\n"For you my liege, this is the finest cheese in all the realm. [cheese_trader.GetSheHe|U] pushes the small block into my hand, leans in and whispers conspiratorially, "It was crafted by cheese-making giants of the Whiterun steppe."\n\nDespite the bizarre comment, the cheese is incredibly good."
 fp2_yearly.1006.a:0 "I'll accept your cheese but not your ridiculous story."

However, the pathetic [fake_cheese_viking.GetWomanMan] in front of me barely looks like a cheese maker — let alone a giant.\n\n"I'm truly sorry, but I'm not really a giant. It's just a lie to help with selling the cheese," [fake_cheese_viking.GetSheHe] sputters."
