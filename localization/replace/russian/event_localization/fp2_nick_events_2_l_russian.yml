[mozarab_merchant.GetSheHe|U] speaks evenly and without rancor, but there's clearly some steel to [mozarab_merchant.GetHerHis] words.\n\n"All we want is for a small section of the [mozarab_quarter.GetName] to call our own and live among our people.

All I want is for my flock to be able to worship in a [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] as all good followers of [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.HighGodName] should!" The nervous priest stops, and looks at me imploringly.\n\nLetting the [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] build places of worship would make converting them trickier, but perhaps some leniency might aid the cohesiveness of my realm?"
