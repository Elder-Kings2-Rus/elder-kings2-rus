"What is this marvelous drink you've offered me?" I ask, to which she responds "milk from an earth almond."\n\nThere is no person who could resist the allure of this concoction on a hot summer day, no child who could avoid smiling when offered a mug, and no Rihadi without a sweet tooth for it. #EMP This beverage isn't milk, it's gold!#!"
