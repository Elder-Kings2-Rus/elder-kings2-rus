I even see [bp1_yearly_9001_shy_kid.GetHerHim] tucked away at times, talking to it as if it were [bp1_yearly_9001_shy_kid.GetHerHis] best friend!\n\n"
 bp1_yearly.9014.desc.lover:0 "I find myself spending more and more time with the sweet and beautiful [bp1_yearly_9007_doppelganger.GetName]. Though once I saw [bp1_yearly_9007_doppelganger.GetHerHim] as little more than a grim reflection of myself, I have come to find [bp1_yearly_9007_doppelganger.GetHerHis] company enjoyable and comforting. As we stroll around my court together, we both freeze as our [ROOT.Char.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')] touch.\n\nBrief as it was, that fleeting moment of flesh on flesh brings fiery roses to my cheeks and as I anxiously turn my eyes to [bp1_yearly_9007_doppelganger.GetNameNoTooltip], it seems [bp1_yearly_9007_doppelganger.GetSheHe] feels the same way.\n\nAm I really so narcissistic that I would even consider calling my double... lover?"

 bp1_yearly.9021.desc:0 "Words cannot even begin to describe the pure hatred in my heart for [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], but alas my duties as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] require that I look past my own feelings and "make love" to this [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.Custom('InsultNoun')].\n\nI expected to hate every moment of it, but as we begin making flaccid coitus, I feel a fire rise through my body that I'd never felt before. Looking at the pure spite and hatred in [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.GetHerHis] eyes, I feel my heart race and my loins excite into action. I can tell [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.GetSheHe] feels the same by the way [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.GetSheHe] pins me down and rubs [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.GetHerHis] [bp1_yearly_9021_rival_spouse.Custom('HandsClawsPaws')] all the way down my body with equal parts contempt and passion. What is this feeling? Love? Hatred? Some vile amalgamation of both?\n\nWhatever this feeling in, it's probably a sin, but can passionate lovemaking between spouses wed in the eyes of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] be a sin? Even if we hate each other, does that mean we cannot enjoy our obligatory copulation?"
 bp1_yearly.9022.desc.drunkard:0 "every time we speak, all I smell is [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalDrink')] on your breath and the words of a brainless drunk falling carelessly from your [ROOT.Char.Custom('MouthSnoutBeak')]. It is fun to indulge in drink every now and then, but to tell the truth, I scarcely remember the last time I saw you sober."
 bp1_yearly.9022.desc.inappetetic:0 "when was the last time you ate something? You're beginning to look like a cadaver, your [ROOT.Char.Custom('SkinScalesFur')] a bag over a shambling tower of bones. When I see you, my nurturing instincts kick in and I just want to see you fill up on something rich and nourishing. How long will it be before you waste away into dust?"

Unless there's some misunderstanding, I'm beginning to wonder how anyone could, in all sincerity, call this [bp1_yearly_9025_friend.GetWomanMan] a friend.\n\nThis is such a disaster and I long for the days when I could just sit quietly in [bp1_yearly_9025_friend.GetHerHis] comforting presence knowing nothing of the rot in [bp1_yearly_9025_friend.GetHerHis] heart."
