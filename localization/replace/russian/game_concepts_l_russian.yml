 game_concept_raid_desc:0 "[armies|E] can be raised as $game_concept_raiders$ from [rally_points|E]. $game_concept_raiders$ can move into neighboring lands and pillage them for [gold|E].\n\nIn order to $game_concept_raid$, a Raiding Army must stop in a [holding|E] owned by a foreign [ruler|E] and choose to start Raiding — upon doing so they will be stuck Raiding for a some time, after which they will get Gold and pillage the Holding.\n\nGold will be stored on the Army, and only added to the treasury when they arrive home. If you defeat a Raiding Army carrying Gold you will take it, and they will be unable to Raid you for some time.\n\nOnly some Rulers are allowed to $game_concept_raid$, most notably [tribal|E] and [pirate|E] Rulers.\nThe Plunderer perk tree also enables raiding."
