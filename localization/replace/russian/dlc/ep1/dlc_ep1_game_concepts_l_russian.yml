 game_concept_court_amenities_desc:0 "$game_concept_court_amenities$ are the set standards of living in the [royal_court|E].\n\nThese are set by the [ruler|E] of the [royal_court|E], with each category (fashion, food, lodging, and servants) having several levels. Spending more on your Amenities typically yields more [court_grandeur_value|E].\n\nRulers with the [GetGovernment( 'pirate_government' ).GetName] use a unique set of Amenities, not directly granting any [grandeur|E]. They instead accumulate Grandeur via [raiding|E], and the amount of Grandeur gained is tied to their $pirate_court_court$ Amenities setting."
