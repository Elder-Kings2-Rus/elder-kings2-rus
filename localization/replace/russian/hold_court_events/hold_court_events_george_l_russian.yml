Worryingly, they are not arguing with each other. \n\n"My lord", begins [rival_1.GetName], "We have to tell you that many in your realm are intensely dissatisfied with the current tax regime. They find it to be unjustifiably extortionate." \n\n[rival_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [rival_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] acting as one on this only indicates to me that the problem is serious."

## Frontier Hero Event
 hold_court.7010.title:0 "A Hero of the Frontier"
 hold_court.7010.byzantine_desc:1 "In the centuries of unremitting warfare between us and the Arabs, we Romans have celebrated our imperial heroes. Occasionally however, our greatest defenders come from more common stock, and I have been following the exploits of [frontier_hero.GetFirstName] most closely. \n\nFor acts of unsurpassed heroism, [frontier_hero.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has become a legend amongst the common folk and has now come to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] for an audience, acclaimed by the peasantry the entire way. \n\nI must reward him for his deeds or risk angering the Roman people, but I cannot help but perceive the resentment emanating from the aristocrats at my court."
 hold_court.7010.reconquista_desc:1 "Relations between us and the [frontier_ruler.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] have always been fraught as we battle the infidel for control of this land. The commoners have suffered terribly during this conflict as I cannot protect them all. \n\nIt seems however, that a new hero of the people has been proclaimed - a lowborn who has fought in the defense of the people time and time again. This hero, called [frontier_hero.GetFirstName], has now come to my court to seek reward for their bravery. \n\nMy court are unanimous that a peasant cannot be granted the same rights as a noble, but would it be just of me to deny them fair recompense for their undoubtedly mighty deeds?"
 hold_court.7010.anglofranco_desc:1 "In the wars against the [frontier_ruler.GetCulture.GetName], we have regularly acclaimed the deeds of our heroic [root.GetCulture.GetName] noblemen, but today I am called upon to honor a peasant by the name of [frontier_hero.GetFirstName]. \n\n[frontier_hero.GetSheHe] has taken it upon themselves to wage war against [frontier_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], and has met with such resounding success that they have won the hearts and minds of the commons. \n\nNow they have arrived at court, doubtless expecting reward, yet my advisors have counseled that to elevate a common would be unacceptable."
 hold_court.7010.default_desc:0 "Over the last few days, I have heard tell of a mighty hero of the peasantry, who has won the hearts and minds of the common people through incredible deeds and matchless bravery. \n\nThis hero, who goes by the name [frontier_hero.GetFirstName], has been defending the smallfolk from the [frontier_ruler.GetCulture.GetName] raiders and has now traveled the way to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] to seek an audience with me. \n\nThere is no doubt that [frontier_hero.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is a great hero, however my court are adamant that I do not elevate a commoner beyond their station."
 hold_court.7010.a:0 ""You shall be rewarded with a place in my household.""

## Court Event 7020
 hold_court.7020.title:0 "Harboring an Exile"
 hold_court.7020.desc:0 "A new arrival to my court today is one [ambassador.GetName], an envoy from my [ambassador_liege.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char )], [ambassador_liege.GetName].\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], it has come to the attention of my liege that you are harboring an individual of particular interest. [exile.GetName] has legitimate claim to the [exile_claim.GetName]. [ambassador_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] requests and demands the return of this errant subject of [ambassador_liege.GetHersHis]."\n\n I send [ambassador.GetNameNoTooltip] out of the room whilst my council deliberates - what should we do?"
 hold_court.7020.a:0 "Give up [exile.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to [ambassador_liege.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 hold_court.7020.b:0 "Refuse to allow [ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to take [exile.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 hold_court.7020.c:0 "Disguise [disguised_exile.GetName] as [exile.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and send [disguised_exile.GetHerHim] instead!"
 hold_court.7020.c.tt:0 "Try to trick [ambassador.GetNameNoTooltip] into taking [disguised_exile.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] instead. The deception will be discovered upon [ambassador.GetHerHis] return to [ambassador_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 hold_court.7020.c.success:0 "You successfully convince [ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. [ambassador_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] will likely be furious when [ambassador_liege.GetSheHe] finds out..."
 hold_court.7020.c.failure:0 "[ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] does not believe you and flees. [ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will bring word of your failed plot to [ambassador_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]"
 hold_court_7020_successful_deception:0 "Successfully deceived [ambassador.GetName]"
 hold_court_7020_failed_deception:0 "You failed to deceive [ambassador.GetName]"
 hold_court_7020_ambassador_returns:0 "[ambassador.GetName] returns"
 hold_court.7021.opening:0 "[ambassador_liege.Custom2('AppropriateGreeting', ROOT.Char)]"
 hold_court.7021.success:0 "I suppose you thought that was terribly clever, disguising [disguised_exile.GetName] as [exile.GetName] and trusting in the ignorance of my envoy to not realize it. I do hope that you weren't too fond of [disguised_exile.GetNameNoTooltip] though - it is a crime in the [ambassador_liege.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] to impersonate a noble, and so [disguised_exile.GetSheHe] was put to death. You and I are now enemies. Damn you to [ambassador_liege.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife]."
 hold_court.7021.failure:0 "My loyal ambassador [ambassador.GetName] informs me that during [ambassador.GetHerHis] recent visit to your court, you attempted to deceive [ambassador.GetHerHim] by poorly disguising a useless nobody as my errant subject [exile.GetName]. My servants are too wily to be caught out by your poor attempts at intrigue however, and although I was unable to return [exile.GetNameNoTooltip] to my court, I can ease my disappointment by spreading word of your bumbling incompetence across the known world. If we ever meet, you and I shall be enemies."
 hold_court.7021.returned:0 "I confess to being most grateful to you, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], for returning [exile.GetName] to [exile.GetHerHis] proper place in my realm. You have proven yourself a most honorable and true friend to [ambassador_liege.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName], and I would be delighted to continue corresponding with you in future. Only a fool would not appreciate the benefits of my holding you in high regard, and you are clearly not a fool. May you be blessed with long life and bountiful harvests."
 hold_court.7021.not_returned:0 "I am deeply upset, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], by your intransigence in not acquiescing to my reasonable request as conveyed to you by my envoy [ambassador.GetName]. Returning [exile.GetName] to me was hardly an irrational demand, and yet you proved yourself to be more reckless and spiteful than wise. [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] is surely doomed to an ignominious end with such unworthy fools as yourself on the throne, one can only hope that your successor does not take after you."
 hold_court.7021.a:0 "Shame about [disguised_exile.GetName], at least [disguised_exile.GetSheHe] was useful."
 hold_court.7021.b:0 "My reputation is ruined!"
 hold_court.7021.c:0 "Strong diplomacy wins out over petty politicking."
 hold_court.7021.d:0 "What bitter words are these?"
